# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of notes I put together for myself and my students. It may grow into a book some day.

This "book"  is an incomplete and strongly biased introduction to Julia for students and resesarchers in engineering disciplines. I put it together as a guide for my students and myself and publish it to help colleagues who have shown an interest in using Julia in their own research.

This book was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books), written on [Emacs](https://emacs.org).

Code is active and the exercises and examples can be downloaded as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks.

All content and examples are published as is and without any guarantee of usefulness or even fitness for purpose^[Although I do think that it will be both useful and is fit for purpose.], let alone elegance.
