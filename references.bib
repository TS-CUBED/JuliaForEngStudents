  abstract = {This paper simulates and predicts the laminar flow inside the 3D aneurysm geometry, since the hemodynamic situation in the blood vessels is difficult to determine and visualize using standard imaging techniques, for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three different types of Lattice Boltzmann (LB) models are computed, namely, single relaxation time (SRT), multiple relaxation time (MRT), and regularized BGK models. The results obtained using these different versions of the LB-based code will then be validated with ANSYS FLUENT, a commercially available finite volume- (FV-) based CFD solver. The simulated flow profiles that include velocity, pressure, and wall shear stress (WSS) are then compared between the two solvers. The predicted outcomes show that all the LB models are comparable and in good agreement with the FVM solver for complex blood flow simulation. The findings also show minor differences in their WSS profiles. The performance of the parallel implementation for each solver is also included and discussed in this paper. In terms of parallelization, it was shown that LBM-based code performed better in terms of the computation time required.},

The two strategies are compared and correlated in defining rheological properties of molten dark chocolates prepared using different PSD, fat and lecithin content. Rheological parameters were determined using a shear rate-controlled rheometer and data examined using correlation, regression and principal component analyses to establish their inter-relationships. Correlation and regression analyses showed high correlation (r = 0.89\textendash 1.00) and regression coefficients (R2 = 0.84\textendash 1.00). The newer International Confectionery Association technique gave higher correlation and regression coefficients than the Casson model, but multivariate principal component analysis showed that the two models were highly related and either could effectively quantify dark chocolate viscosity parameters.},

Therefore, to facilitate this role, pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure, high-flow system. Pulmonary circulation can accommodate any changes in blood flow due to relative passivity and the ability to recruit unperfused vessels. Several factors such as gravity, lung inflation, alveolar surface tension, and blood viscosity can influence pulmonary circulation under both physiological and pathological conditions. For instance, in an upright position, gravity increases both blood flow and ventilation in caudal regions, with a greater change in blood flow than ventilation. As a result, there is a gradual decrease in ventilation-to-perfusion ratios from the apex to the base of the lung in an upright position. The inflation of the lung can compress and distort vessels and alter blood flow through pulmonary circulation. The alveolar surface tension attenuates lung capillary resistance and promotes capillary blood flow. In contrast, an increase in blood viscosity or hematocrit decreases pulmonary flow.},

The simplicity of formulation and its versatility explain the rapid expansion of the LB method to applications in complex and multiscale flows. We review many significant developments over the past decade with specific examples. Some of the most active developments include the entropic LB method and the application of the LB method to turbulent flow, multiphase flow, and deformable particle and fiber suspensions. Hybrid methods based on the combination of the Eulerian lattice with a Lagrangian grid system for the simulation of moving deformable boundaries show promise for more efficient applications to a broader class of problems. We also discuss higher-order boundary conditions and the simulation of microchannel flow with finite Knudsen number. Additionally, the remarkable scalability of the LB method for parallel processing is shown with examples. Teraflop simulations with the LB method are routine, and there is no doubt that this method will be one of the first candidates for petaflop computational fluid dynamics in the near future.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is applied to study the unsteady flow inside a pulsatile pump left ventricular assist device, in order to assess the sensitivity to a range of commonly used turbulence models. Levels of strain and wall shear stress are directly relevant to the evaluation of risk from haemolysis and thrombosis, and thus understanding the sensitivity to these turbulence models is important in the assessment of uncertainty in CFD predictions. The study focuses on a positive displacement or pulsatile pump, and the CFD model includes valves and moving pusher plate. An unstructured dynamic layering method was employed to capture this cyclic motion, and valves were simulated in their fully open position to mimic the natural scenario, with in/outflow triggered at control planes away from the valves. Six turbulence models have been used, comprising three relevant to the low Reynolds number nature of this flow and three more intended to investigate different transport effects. In the first group, we consider the shear stress transport (SST) model in both its standard and transition-sensitive forms, and the `laminar' model in which no turbulence model is used. In the second group, we compare the one equation Spalart\textendash Almaras model, the standard two equation and the full Reynolds stress model (RSM). Following evaluation of spatial and temporal resolution requirements, results are compared with available experimental data. The model was operated at a systolic duration of 40\% of the pumping cycle and a pumping rate of 86 BPM (beats per minute). Contrary to reasonable preconception, the `transition' model, calibrated to incorporate additional physical modelling specifically for these flow conditions, was not noticeably superior to the standard form of the model. Indeed, observations of turbulent viscosity ratio reveal that the transition model initiates a premature increase of turbulence in this flow, when compared with both experimental and higher order numerical results previously reported in the literature. Furthermore, the RSM is indicated to provide the most accurate prediction over much of the flow, due to its ability to more correctly account for three-dimensional effects. Finally, the clinical relevance of the results is reported along with a discussion on the impact of such modelling uncertainties.},

The calculations used unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier2013Stokes formulation with non-Newtonian blood properties. The results were used to predict platelet damage from total stress (shear, turbulent, deformation), and incorporate the contribution of repeated passages of the platelets along pertinent trajectories. Trajectories that exposed the platelets to elevated levels of stress around the MHV leaflets and led them to entrapment within the complex 3-D vortical structures in the wake of the valve significantly enhanced platelet activation.

  abstract = {Introduction Dietary omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with protection from atherosclerosis. However, the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Blood flow generate a frictional force on endothelial cells called wall shear stress (WSS) that alters vascular wall function. The aim of this study was to determine whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, modulates vascular wall inflammation, blood flow velocity and WSS in experimental atherosclerosis. Methods ApoE\textendash/\textendash{} mice fed either high fat diet (control) or high fat diet plus DHA (300 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks (n = 12/group). Blood flow velocity was assessed using pulsed wave doppler echocardiography and blood pressure was monitored using Visitech tail-cuff system. Atherosclerosis was measured in whole aorta using enface Oil red O stain, and in aortic roots and brachiocephalic sections stained with Alcian Blue \& Elastic Van Gieson stain. Computational flow dynamics (CFD) was used to map WSS magnitude and oscillation in the aorta. Plasma cholesterol levels were quantified by gas chromatography. Results Plasma high density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio was significantly increased in DHA treated mice compared to controls (10.77 {$\pm$} 1.86 vs. 6.63 {$\pm$} 1.04, p {$<$} 0.05). DHA fed mice exhibited a 4\textendash 5 fold reduction in distal aortic and brachiocephalic atherosclerosis (p {$<$} 0.01) whereas lesion burden in the aortic arch was similar between groups. Dietary supplementation using DHA led to a reduction in blood pressure (119.5 {$\pm$} 7.33 mmHg (+DHA) vs. 159.7 {$\pm$} 2.482 mmHg (controls), p {$<$} 0.001 and a 12\% decrease in aortic blood flow. CFD revealed that oscillatory shear in the descending aorta was reduced in DHA-fed mice compared to controls. Conclusions/Implications Our study suggests that dietary DHA can act systemically by enhancing levels of HDL. It can also act locally by reducing oscillatory shear stress in the descending aorta. Dietary DHA reduced lesion formation specifically in the descending aorta, an effect that can be explained by its dual effects on oscillatory shear and HDL. Therefore, the current study suggests novel and interacting protective mechanisms for DHA actions in atherogenesis with implications for the development of dietary interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease.},

Muscle forces of the gastrocnemius and soleus were estimated from experimental data collected in a motion capture laboratory during barefoot running for 11 runners utilizing a rearfoot strike (RFS) and 8 runners utilizing a non-RFS (NRFS) pattern. Our results show that peak Achilles tendon force occurred earlier in stance phase (p = 0.007), which contributed to a 15\% increase in average Achilles tendon loading rate among participants adopting a NRFS pattern (p = 0.06). Stance time, step length, and the estimated number of steps per mile were similar between groups. However, runners with a NRFS pattern experienced 11\% greater Achilles tendon impulse each step (p = 0.05) and nearly significantly greater Achilles tendon impulse per mile run (p = 0.06). This difference equates to an additional 47.7 body weights for each mile run with a NRFS pattern. Runners considering a NRFS pattern may want to account for these novel stressors and adapt training programs accordingly.},

The circular plate is assumed to be in contact with a liquid on one side and placed into the hole of an infinite rigid wall; this is the problem studied by Lamb. The change in natural frequencies is first calculated using the so-called nondimensional added virtual mass incremental (NAVMI) factor which reflects the increase of kinetic energy due to the liquid. The analytical expression of NAVMI factors for circular plates possessing axisymmetric boundary conditions is obtained. The more accurate Rayleigh-Ritz solution of the problem is then taken and compared to the results obtained by using the NAVMI factors.

  abstract = {In this paper, we have proposed a new non-linear constitutive model for blood with a viscosity which depends on the shear rate and the volume fraction of red blood cells or RBCs (hematocrit). The viscosity correlation is obtained from the experimental data reported in the literature. The governing equations for flow between two flat plates are made dimensionless and solved numerically. A parametric study is performed to study the effect of the four non-dimensional numbers K1 (a relative measure of the pressure gradient to viscous forces), K2 (a relative measure of gravitational force to pressure gradient in the direction of the gravity), N (dimensionless average hematocrit of blood), and {$\phi$}m (maximum packing fraction of RBCs). The results show good qualitative agreement with other studies.},

  abstract = {A new generalization of the Oldroyd-B model is developed to describe the flow of blood. The model is developed within a thermodynamic framework which recognizes that a viscoelastic fluid can remain stress free in multiple configurations. The new model is an improvement over an earlier model developed within the same framework to describe the response characteristics of blood. It captures the shear-thinning and deformation-dependent viscoelastic behavior of blood just like the previous model. More importantly, unlike the previous model, it does not have the shortcoming of an abrupt transition of the material properties at low shear rates: instead, it allows for a smooth variation of the rate of dissipation, and therefore viscosity, over the entire range of physically feasible shear-rates. This feature is very attractive for developing high-fidelity numerical methods for application to the complex geometries that are typically encountered in the human vasculature. Convergence of the numerical method in simple geometries shows its superior properties as compared to the earlier model: this demonstration of model performance is a precursor to its use in 3D geometries.},

We give an overview of the developments in modelling of blood rheology and clot formation/lysis in the last 10 to 15 years. In blood rheology, advances are increasingly supplemented by flow simulation studies. In clot formation (or coagulation), advances have taken place in both single-scale modeling under quiescent conditions as well as in multi-scale modeling in the presence of flow. The future will possibly see more blood flow simulations in complex geometries and, simultaneously, development and simulation of multi-scale models for clot formation and lysis.},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are becoming a reliable tool to understand hemodynamics, disease progression in pathological blood vessels and to predict medical device performance. Immersed boundary method (IBM) emerged as an attractive methodology because of its ability to efficiently handle complex moving and rotating geometries on structured grids. However, its application to study blood flow in complex, branching, patient-specific anatomies is scarce. This is because of the dominance of grid nodes in the exterior of the fluid domain over the useful grid nodes in the interior, rendering an inevitable memory and computational overhead. In order to alleviate this problem, we propose a novel multiblock based IBM that preserves the simplicity and effectiveness of the IBM on structured Cartesian meshes and enables handling of complex, anatomical geometries at a reduced memory overhead by minimizing the grid nodes in the exterior of the fluid domain. As pathological and medical device hemodynamics often involve complex, unsteady transitional or turbulent flow fields, a scale resolving turbulence model such as large eddy simulation (LES) is used in the present work. The proposed solver (here after referred as WenoHemo), is developed by enhancing an existing in-house high-order incompressible flow solver that was previously validated for its numerics and several LES models by Shetty et al. (2010) [33]. In the present work, W e n o H e m o is systematically validated for additional numerics introduced, such as IBM and the multiblock approach, by simulating laminar flow over a sphere and laminar flow over a backward facing step respectively. Then, we validate the entire solver methodology by simulating laminar and transitional flow in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Finally, we perform blood flow simulations in the challenging clinically relevant thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), to gain insights into the type of fluid flow patterns that exist in pathological blood vessels. Results obtained from the TAA simulations reveal complex vortical and unsteady flow fields that need to be considered in designing and implanting medical devices such as stent grafts. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

A validated computational model of a microaxial blood pump is used for detailed analysis of shear stress distribution. Several methods are presented that allow for a qualitative assessment of shear stress distribution and related exposure times using a Lagrangian approach and mass distribution in combination with shear stress analysis. The results show that CFD offers a convenient tool for the general assessment of shear-induced hemolysis. The determination of critical regions and an estimation of the amount of blood subject to potential damage in relation to the total mass flow are shown to be feasible. However , awareness of limitations and potential flaws in CFD based hemolysis assessments is crucial. Key Words: Computational fluid dynamics-Hemolysis assessment.},

We investigated biomarker distributions and compound specific isotopic signatures in sediments from sites on the Northern European continental margin that are characterized by a diffusive flux of methane. At all sites, the organic matter (OM) is predominantly derived from terrestrial higher plants, with subordinate abundances of algal biomarkers, but biomarkers for archaea and bacteria are also present. The co-occurrence of the archaeal lipids archaeol, sn-2-hydroxyarchaeol and 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI) with non-isoprenoidal glycerol diethers inferred to derive from sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is similar to microbial biomarker assemblages observed at cold seeps. The archaeal and inferred SRB biomarker concentrations typically reach maxima close to the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ), where archaeal biomarkers are depleted in 13C. The 16S rRNA gene sequences from the SMTZ of the Aarhus Bay sediment core indicate the occurrence of ANME-1 archaea, consistent with inferences derived from biomarker distributions. The observations suggest that AOM in these diffusive settings is mediated by consortia of archaea and bacteria similar to those found at many seep and methane hydrate sites around the world.},

A pulsatility index (PI) is calculated from the pressure difference, which is deduced from the axial thrust measured by the magnetic bearing of the pump. The gradient of PI with respect to pump speed (GPI) is estimated via online system identification. The outer loop of a cascaded controller regulates GPI to a reference value satisfying the selected control objective. The inner loop controls the PI to a reference value set by the outer loop. Adverse pumping states such as suction and regurgitation can be detected on the basis of the GPI estimates and corrected by the controller. A lumped-parameter computer model of the assisted circulation was used to simulate variations of ventricular contractility, pulmonary venous pressure, and aortic pressure. The performance of the outer control loop was demonstrated by transitions between the two control modes. Fast reaction of the inner loop was tested by stepwise reduction of venous return. For maximum support, a low PI was maintained without inducing ventricular collapse. For maximum washout, the pump worked at a high PI in the transition region between the opening and the permanently closed AoV. The cascaded control of GPI and PI is able to meet different control objectives and is worth testing in vitro and in vivo.\dbend\dbend},

Central features of this implantable pump are a centrally integrated motor, a blood-immersed mechanical bearing, magnetic coupling of the impeller, and a shrouded impeller, which allows a relatively wide clearance. The aim of the study was a numerical analysis of hydraulic and hemolytic properties of different impeller design configurations. In vitro testing and numerical simulation techniques (computational fluid dynamics [CFD]) were applied to achieve a comprehensive overview. Pressure-flow charts were experimentally measured in a mock loop in order to validate the CFD data. In vitro hemolysis tests were performed at the main operating point of each impeller design. General fiow patterns, pressure-flow charts, secondary fiow rates, torque, and axial forces on the impeller were calculated by means of CFD. Furthermore, based on streak line techniques, shear stress (stress loading), exposure times, and volume percentage with critical stress loading have been determined. Comparison of CFD data with pressure head measurements showed excellent agreement. Also, impressive trend conformity was observed between in-vitro hemolysis results and numerical data. Comparison of design variations yielded clear trends and results. Design C revealed the best hydraulic and hemolytic properties and was chosen as the final design for the mixed-flow rotary blood pump.

  abstract = {Computational modeling of blood flow in microvessels with internal diameter 20-500 \textmu m is a major challenge. It is because blood in such vessels behaves as a multiphase suspension of deformable particles. A continuum model of blood is not adequate if the motion of individual red blood cells in the suspension is of interest. At the same time, multiple cells, often a few thousands in number, must also be considered to account for cell-cell hydrodynamic interaction. Moreover, the red blood cells (RBCs) are highly deformable. Deformation of the cells must also be considered in the model, as it is a major determinant of many physiologically significant phenomena, such as formation of a cell-free layer, and the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect. In this article, we present two-dimensional computational simulation of blood flow in vessels of size 20-300 \textmu m at discharge hematocrit of 10-60\%, taking into consideration the particulate nature of blood and cell deformation. The numerical model is based on the immersed boundary method, and the red blood cells are modeled as liquid capsules. A large RBC population comprising of as many as 2500 cells are simulated. Migration of the cells normal to the wall of the vessel and the formation of the cell-free layer are studied. Results on the trajectory and velocity traces of the RBCs, and their fluctuations are presented. Also presented are the results on the plug-flow velocity profile of blood, the apparent viscosity, and the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect. The numerical results also allow us to investigate the variation of apparent blood viscosity along the cross-section of a vessel. The computational results are compared with the experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first simulation to simultaneously consider a large ensemble of red blood cells and the cell deformation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The concentration distribution was obtained considering thermophoresis, non-uniform shear rate, Brownian diffusion and viscosity gradient. Using the scale analysis, it was demonstrated that thermophoresis can have a significant effect on the particle migration. Dispersion approach was used for simulation, while a non-uniform concentration was applied. An experimental study was conducted to examine the numerical solution accuracy and there was a good agreement between the experimental and numerical results. Non-uniformity of the concentration is intensified by increasing the Reynolds number and the particle size. Thermophoresis makes the concentration more non-uniform and the velocity profile flatter as well. At greater mean concentrations, the effect of thermophoresis on particle distribution and convective heat transfer coefficient is highlighted. Meanwhile, considering thermophoresis yields greater convective heat transfer coefficient in all Reynolds numbers.},

The results indicate that hematocrite (HCT) increased as EMF increases while the viscocity decreased with the increase of EMF. Red blood cell permeability, deformability and the electrical properties of hemoglobin (conductivity and relaxation time) were also examined. The results show that EMF produces pronounced changes in the molecular structure of hemoglobin and induced force acting on the charged particle of charge q which may activate Rouleau formation of red blood cells (RBCs).},

While numerous computational models exist to study either the electrical or the mechanical response of its individual chambers, the integrative electro-mechanical response of the whole heart remains poorly understood. Here we present a proof-of-concept simulator for a four-chamber human heart model created from computer topography and magnetic resonance images. We illustrate the governing equations of excitatione - contraction coupling and discretize them using a single, unified finite element environment. To illustrate the basic features of our model, we visualize the electrical potential and the mechanical deformation across the human heart throughout its cardiac cycle. To compare our simulation against common metrics of cardiac function, we extract the pressure - volume relationship and show that it agrees well with clinical observations. Our prototype model allows us to explore and understand the key features, physics, and technologies to create an integrative, predictive model of the living human heart. Ultimately, our simulator will open opportunities to probe landscapes of clinical parameters, and guide device design and treatment planning in cardiac diseases such as stenosis, regurgitation, or prolapse of the aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, or mitral valve.},

Under intraoperative TEE guidance, a 41-year-old woman underwent an attempted explantation of a LVAD, which had been implanted 8 months before for dilated cardiomyopathy. When LVAD support was discontinued, previously normal left ventricular function deteriorated, and aortic stenosis from aortic valve cusp fusion was documented by TEE.

Analysis of newly acquired three-dimensional seismic images and drilling data from a large gas hydrate province reveal a recently eroded v-shaped depression. The depression sharply cuts through a relic bottom simulating reflection (BSR) and hydrate-laden sediments. The shape of the relic BSR indicates that the seafloor depression was once a large anticline that has recently been eroded and released an estimated 1.51 \texttimes{} 1011 m3 of methane. We hypothesize that erosion of the seafloor via bottom-water currents unroofed buoyant hydrate-laden sediments and subhydrate overpressured free gas zones beneath the anticline. Once triggered, gas-driven erosion created a positive feedback mechanism, releasing gas and eroding hydrate-bearing sediment. We suggest that erosive currents in deep-water methane hydrate provinces act as hair triggers, destabilizing kilometer-scale swaths of the seafloor where large concentrations of underlying overpressured methane exist. Our analysis suggests that kilometer-scale degassing events are widespread, and that deep-water hydrate reservoirs can rapidly release methane in massive quantities.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is one of the most dangerous forms of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to its asymptomatic nature during its early stages of development. The carotid sinus is a favorable location for plaque progression because of the temporal disturbances experienced in its environment. By performing a transient Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) on a healthy idealized carotid artery, zones of low Wall Shear Stress (WSS) were isolated as these regions are prone to plaque formation. A plaque was then constructed in the vicinity of these zones leading to lumen stenosis. The influence and variation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as WSS, Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), and helicity were then analyzed in the stenosed artery, and compared to that of the healthy one. Significant variation in vessel deformation, an FSI exclusive parameter, was seen due to atherosclerotic obstruction near the bifurcation apex. Elevated WSS, OSI, and velocity levels were observed, especially around the sinus. Regions with low helical intensity corresponded to high particle residence times which originated at the sinus and developed well into the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA). All signs point to further progression of atherosclerosis, with high OSI and RRT indicating a further increase in the degrees of stenosis, or potential thrombus formation at the carotid sinus in case of plaque rupture due to increased velocity and WSS levels.},

  abstract = {In recent years the role of FSI (fluid-structure interaction) simulations in the analysis of the fluid-mechanics of heart valves is becoming more and more important, being able to capture the interaction between the blood and both the surrounding biological tissues and the valve itself. When setting up an FSI simulation, several choices have to be made to select the most suitable approach for the case of interest: in particular, to simulate flexible leaflet cardiac valves, the type of discretization of the fluid domain is crucial, which can be described with an ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) or an Eulerian formulation. The majority of the reported 3D heart valve FSI simulations are performed with the Eulerian formulation, allowing for large deformations of the domains without compromising the quality of the fluid grid. Nevertheless, it is known that the ALE-FSI approach guarantees more accurate results at the interface between the solid and the fluid. The goal of this paper is to describe the same aortic valve model in the two cases, comparing the performances of an ALE-based FSI solution and an Eulerian-based FSI approach. After a first simplified 2D case, the aortic geometry was considered in a full 3D set-up. The model was kept as similar as possible in the two settings, to better compare the simulations' outcomes. Although for the 2D case the differences were unsubstantial, in our experience the performance of a full 3D ALE-FSI simulation was significantly limited by the technical problems and requirements inherent to the ALE formulation, mainly related to the mesh motion and deformation of the fluid domain. As a secondary outcome of this work, it is important to point out that the choice of the solver also influenced the reliability of the final results.},

Two proposed explanations for this presumed global carbon cycle perturbation are the liberation of massive amounts of isotopically light CH4 from (1) Gondwanan coals by heating during the intrusive eruption of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province (LIP) or (2) the thermal dissociation of gas hydrates. Carbon cycle modeling indicates that the release of CH4 from Gondwanan coals synchronous with the eruption of the Karoo-Ferrar LIP fails to reproduce the magnitude or timing of the CO2 and {$\delta$}13C excursions. However, sensitivity analyses constrained by a marine cyclostratigraphically dated {$\delta$}13C record indicate that both features of geologic record can be explained with the huge input of {$\sim$}15,340-24,750 Gt C over {$\sim$}220 k.y., a result possibly pointing to the involvement of hydrothermal vent complexes in the Karoo Basin. The simulated release of {$>$}6000 Gt C from gas hydrates also reproduces aspects of the early Toarcian rock record, but the large mass involved raises fundamental questions about its formation, storage, and release.},

However, prior reports varied in their adjustment for potential confounders.Methods and ResultsCarotid tonometry waveform data from 2539 participants (mean age 63{$\pm$}11~years, 58\% women) of the Framingham Heart Study were used to derive Windkessel measures using pressure and assuming a linear model with fixed diastolic time constant ({$\tau$}dias) and variable asymptotic pressure (Pinf, median 54.5; 25th, 75th percentiles: 38.4, 64.9~mm~Hg) or nonlinear model with inverse pressure-dependent {$\tau$}dias and fixed Pinf (20~mm~Hg). During follow-up (median 15.1~years), 459 (18\%) participants had a first cardiovascular disease event. In proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, and physician-acquired systolic blood pressure, only the systolic time constant ({$\tau$}sys) derived from the nonlinear model was related to risk for cardiovascular disease events (hazard ratio=0.91 per 1~SD, 95\% CI=0.84\textendash 0.99, P=0.04). When heart rate was added to the model, {$\tau$}sys (hazard ratio=0.92, CI=0.84\textendash 1.00, P=0.04) and reservoir pressure amplitude (hazard ratio=1.14, CI=1.01\textendash 1.28, P=0.04) were related to events. In contrast, measures derived from the linear model were not related to events in models that adjusted for risk factors including systolic blood pressure (P{$>$}0.31) and heart rate (P{$>$}0.19).ConclusionsOur results suggest that pressure-only Windkessel measures derived by using a nonlinear model may provide incremental risk stratification, although associations were modest and further validation is required.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the role of the aortic elastic properties indicates their relevance at several sites of cardiovascular function. Acting as an elastic buffering chamber behind the heart (the Windkessel function), the aorta and some of the proximal large vessels store about 50\% of the left ventricular stroke volume during systole. In diastole, the elastic forces of the aortic wall forward this 50\% of the volume to the peripheral circulation, thus creating a nearly continuous peripheral blood flow. This systolic-diastolic interplay represents theWindkessel function, which has an influence not only on the peripheral circulation but also on the heart, resulting in a reduction of left ventricular afterload and improvement in coronary blood flow and left ventricular relaxation. The elastic resistance (or stiffness), which the aorta sets against its systolic distention, increases with aging, with an increase in blood pressure, and with pathological changes such as atherosclerosis. This increased stiffness leads to an increase in systolic blood pressure and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure at any given mean pressure, an increase in systolic blood velocity, an increase in left ventricular afterload, and a decrease in subendocardial blood supply during diastole, and must be considered a major pathophysiological factor, for example, in systolic hypertension. The elastic properties of the aortic Windkessel can be assessed in vivo in humans in several ways, most easily by measuring the pulse wave velocity along the aorta. The higher this velocity, the higher the elastic resistance, that is, the stiffness. Other methods depend on assessment of the ratio between pulse pressure and aortic volume changes ({$\Delta$}P/{$\Delta$}V), which can be assessed noninvasively by ultrasonic or tomographic methods. All assessments of vessel stiffness have to take into account the direct effect of current blood pressure, and thus judgements about influences of interventions rely on an unchanged blood pressure. Alternatively, to derive the ``intrinsic'' stiffness of the aortic wall one has to correct for the effect of the blood pressure present. Recently reports about pharmacologic influences on the elastic properties of the aorta have emerged in the literature. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nitric oxide (NO) donors seem to directly reduce the elastic resistance of the aorta. This effect, in addition to other effects on blood pressure and the peripheral circulation, could have major clinical relevance as an additional mechanism for unloading the left ventricle, improving coronary circulation, and reducing the pulsatile stress of the arterial system.},

  abstract = {Vortices may have a role in optimizing mechanical efficiency and blood mixing of the LV. We aimed to characterize size, position, circulation, and kinetic energy (KE) of LV main vortex cores in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM), and analyze their physiological correlates. We used digital processing of color-Doppler images to study flow evolution in 61 patients with NIDCM and 61 age-matched controls. Vortex features showed a characteristic biphasic temporal course during diastole. Because late filling contributed significantly to flow entrainment, vortex KE reached its maximum at the time of peak-A wave, storing 26 {$\pm$} 20\% of total KE delivered by inflow [range 1 to 74\%]. Patients with NIDCM showed larger and stronger vortices than controls (circulation: 0.008 {$\pm$} 0.007 versus 0.006 {$\pm$} 0.005 m2/s, respectively, p= 0.02; KE: 7 {$\pm$} 8 vs. 5 {$\pm$} 5 mJ/m, p= 0.04), even when corrected for LV size. This helped confining the filling jet in the dilated ventricle. The vortex Reynolds number was also higher in the NIDCM group. By multivariate analysis, vortex KE was related to the KE generated by inflow and to chamber short-axis diameter. In 21 patients studied head-to-head, Doppler measurements of circulation and KE closely correlated with phase-contract magnetic resonance values (Ric= 0.82 and 0.76, respectively). Thus, the biphasic nature of filling determines normal vortex physiology. Vortex formation is exaggerated in patients with NIDCM due to chamber remodeling, and enlarged vortices are helpful for ameliorating convective pressure losses and facilitating transport. These findings can be accurately studied using ultrasound.},

  abstract = {Shear-induced migration of red blood cells (RBCs) is a well-known phenomenon characterizing blood flow in the small vessels (micrometre to millimetre size) of the cardiovascular system. In large vessels, like the abdominal aorta and the carotid artery (millimetre to centimetre size), the extent of this migration and its interaction with secondary flows has not been fully elucidated. RBC migration exerts its influence primarily on platelet concentration, oxygen transport and oxygen availability at the luminal surface, which could influence vessel wall disease processes in and adjacent to the intima. Phillips' shear-induced particle migration model, coupled to the Quemada viscosity model, was employed to simulate the macroscopic behaviour of RBCs in four patient-specific geometries: a normal abdominal aorta, an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a normal carotid bifurcation and a stenotic carotid bifurcation. Simulations show a migration of RBCs from the near-wall region with a lowering of wall haematocrit (volume fraction of RBCs) on the posterior side of the normal aorta and on the lateral-external side of the iliac arteries. A marked migration is observed on the outer wall of the carotid sinus, along the common carotid artery and in the carotid stenosis. No significant migration is observed in the AAA. The spatial and temporal patterns of wall haematocrit are correlated with the near-wall shear layer and with the secondary flows induced by the vessel curvature. In particular, secondary flows accentuate the initial lowering in RBC near-wall concentration by convecting RBCs from the inner curvature side to the outer curvature side. The results reinforce data in literature showing a decrease in oxygen partial pressure on the inner curvature wall of the carotid sinus induced by the presence of secondary flows. The lowering of wall haematocrit is postulated to induce a decrease in oxygen availability at the luminal surface through a diminished concentration of oxyhaemoglobin, hence contributing, with the reported lowered oxygen partial pressure, to local hypoxia.},

  abstract = {Physics-based models can be applied to describe mechanisms in both health and disease, which has the potential to accelerate the development of personalized medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of personalizing a model of systemic hemodynamics by estimating model parameters. We investigated the feasibility of estimating model parameters for a closed-loop lumped parameter model of the left heart and systemic circulation using the step-wise subset reduction method. This proceeded by first investigating the structural identifiability of the model parameters. Secondly, we performed sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters were most influential on the most relevant model outputs. Finally, we constructed a sequence of progressively smaller subsets including parameters based on their ranking by model output influence. The model was then optimized to data for each set of parameters to evaluate how well the parameters could be estimated for each subset. The subsequent results allowed assessment of how different data sets, and noise affected the parameter estimates. In the noiseless case, all parameters could be calibrated to less than 10-3\% error using time series data, while errors using clinical index data could reach over 100\%. With 5\% normally distributed noise the accuracy was limited to be within 10\% error for the five most sensitive parameters, while the four least sensitive parameters were unreliably estimated for waveform data. The three least sensitive parameters were particularly challenging to estimate so these should be prioritized for measurement. Cost functions based on time series such as pressure waveforms, were found to give better parameter estimates than cost functions based on standard indices used in clinical assessment of the cardiovascular system, for example stroke volume (SV) and pulse pressure (PP). Averaged parameter estimate errors were reduced by several orders of magnitude by choosing waveforms for noiseless synthetic data. Also when measurement data were noisy, the parameter estimation procedure based on continuous waveforms was more accurate than that based on clinical indices. By application of the stepwise subset reduction method we demonstrated that by the addition of venous pressure to the cost function, or conversely fixing the systemic venous compliance parameter at an accurate value improved all parameter estimates, especially the diastolic filling parameters which have least influence on the aortic pressure.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the correlation between mechanical loading of formed blood elements and the amount of their destruction is important for the prediction of blood trauma in artificial circulatory devices as well as in natural circulation. A hemodynamic assessment and optimization of artificial organs to minimize trauma could be undertaken in the design phase given a comprehensive mechanical blood damage model. A theory to determine blood trauma theoretically as a combination of a mechanical loading analysis and a phenomenological blood damage resistance hypothesis is presented. Arbitrary stress-time functions of blood particles predicted by flow analysis are reduced to a set of simple time functions for which the damage behavior may, in principle, be obtained from mechanical blood damage tests. A classification of those stress functions into damaging and nondamaging parts is followed by an overall trauma prediction considering cumulative effects by means of a damage accumulation hypothesis. Theoretical determination of blood destruction caused by mechanical stresses in a centrifugal pump is one possible application of the proposed theory. The strategy of hemolysis prediction is demonstrated for the Aries Medical Isoflow Pump. Irregular stress-time loading functions of particles passing the pump domain obtained by three-dimensional numerical flow simulations were reduced and classified into harmonic components. To relate these functions to their hemolytic response can only be done in a qualitative manner since blood damage behavior under transient stress loading has not been sufficiently investigated. Accurate prediction of blood trauma using the proposed theory will require detailed study of the influence of frequency and amplitude of harmonic stress loading on formed blood elements.}

Data on VADs as a bridge to transplantation in children are limited. Methods and Results\textendash{} A multi-institutional, prospectively maintained database of outcomes in children after listing for heart transplantation (n=2375) was used to analyze outcomes of VAD patients (n=99, 4\%) listed between January 1993 and December 2003. Median age at VAD implantation was 13.3 years (range, 2 days to 17.9 years); diagnoses were cardiomyopathy (78\%) and congenital heart disease (22\%). Mean duration of support was 57 days (range, 1 to 465 days). Seventy-three percent were supported with a long-term device, with 39\% requiring biventricular support. Seventy-seven patients (77\%) survived to transplantation, 5 patients were successfully weaned from support and recovered, and 17 patients (17\%) died on support. In the recent era (2000 to 2003), successful bridge to transplantation with VAD was achieved in 86\% of patients. Peak hazard for death while waiting was the first 2 weeks after VAD placement. Risk factors for death while awaiting a transplant included earlier era of implantation (P=0.05), female gender (P=0.02), and congenital disease diagnosis (P=0.05). There was no difference in 5-year survival after transplantation for patients on VAD at time of transplantation as compared with those not requiring VAD. Conclusions\textendash{} VAD support in children successfully bridged 77\% of patients to transplantation, with posttransplantation outcomes comparable to those not requiring VAD. These encouraging results emphasize the need to further understand patient selection and to delineate the impact of VAD technology for children.},

The geometrical features of the left ventricle are approximated by three-dimensional segmentation of experimental clinical images obtained from multispiral computer tomography (MSCT). The model adequately describes the possible configuration of swirling flow in the left ventricle and is a part of a comprehensive study of swirling flows in different compartments of heart, which comply with a family of the exact solutions of hydrodynamic Navier\textendash Stokes equations for the class of quasipotential1 swirling flows. Computer visualization shows how simulated by SPH method jet of a model liquid, which is placed in limited space, remains continuity and keeps its clockwise vorticity along the direction of the flow propagation during the whole cycle. Then it turns on approximately 120\textdegree{} by the time of ejection into the aorta. Such structure of the flow provides more effective pumping of blood as a model liquid through the ventricle as compared to a lamellar flow mode. \textcopyright{} 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

  abstract = {Aims Coronary artery stents have profound effects on arterial function by altering fluid flow mass transport and wall shear stress. We developed a new integrated methodology to analyse the effects of stents on mass transport and shear stress to inform the design of haemodynamically-favourable stents. Methods and results Stents were deployed in model vessels followed by tracking of fluorescent particles under flow. Parallel analyses involved high-resolution micro-computed tomography scanning followed by computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess wall shear stress distribution. Several stent designs were analysed to assess whether the workflow was robust for diverse strut geometries. Stents had striking effects on fluid flow streamlines, flow separation or funnelling, and the accumulation of particles at areas of complex geometry that were tightly coupled to stent shape. CFD analysis revealed that stents had a major influence on wall shear stress magnitude, direction and distribution and this was highly sensitive to geometry. Conclusions Integration of particle tracking with CFD allows assessment of fluid flow and shear stress in stented arteries in unprecedented detail. Deleterious flow perturbations, such as accumulation of particles at struts and non-physiological shear stress, were highly sensitive to individual stent geometry. Novel designs for stents should be tested for mass transport and shear stress which are important effectors of vascular health and repair.},

The efficiency of such a pumping function is dependent on blood flow within the LV chamber. It is therefore crucial to accurately characterize LV hemodynamics. Improved understanding of LV hemodynamics is expected to provide important clinical diagnostic and prognostic information. We review the recent advances in numerical and experimental methods for characterizing LV flows and focus on analysis of intraventricular flow fields by echocardiographic particle image velocimetry (echo-PIV), due to its potential for broad and practical utility. Future research directions to advance patient-specific LV simulations include development of methods capable of resolving heart valves, higher temporal resolution, automated generation of three-dimensional (3D) geometry, and incorporating actual flow measurements into the numerical solution of the 3D cardiovascular fluid dynamics.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework for rigid bodies has been extended to deformable soft tissue by coupling a sharp-interface immersed boundary incompressible Navier-Stokes solver for fluids with a non-linear large deformation finite element method for soft tissue. A Fung-type constitutive law is used for the soft tissue of heart valves that can capture the experimentally observed non-linear anisotropic stress-strain behavior of the heart valve tissue. The FSI solver adopts a strongly-coupled partitioned approach that is stabilized with under-relaxation and the Aitken acceleration technique. The finite element solver is verified against the benchmark experimental and numerical data for heart valve tissue while the immersed boundary solver was validated against flow measurements of a mechanical heart valve in the previous work. The capabilities of the solver are demonstrated by simulating the first fully three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction of tissue valves implanted in the aortic position during systole under physiologic flow conditions. It is observed that the flow's threefold symmetry breaks during the early systole, questioning the threefold symmetry assumption of previous simulations. The flow created by the tissue valve is compared against the mechanical heart valve under the same conditions. The flowfields, created by the tissue and mechanical valves, show drastic differences at different instances during a heartbeat cycle. Mainly, the breakdown of vortices into small-scale vortical structures right before the peak systole in mechanical heart valves is not observed in the bio-prosthetic heart valves. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.}

In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.},

However, the proximity of the pilot (front) and the stoker (rear) and the associated strong aerodynamic interactions between both athletes present substantial challenges for CFD simulations, the results of which can be very sensitive to computational parameters such as grid topology and turbulence model. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first CFD and wind-tunnel investigation on tandem cycling aerodynamics. The study analyses the influence of the CFD grid topology and the turbulence model on the aerodynamic forces on pilot and stoker and compares the results with wind-tunnel measurements. It is shown that certain combinations of grid topology and turbulence model give trends that are opposite to those shown by other combinations. Indeed, some combinations provide counter-intuitive drag outcomes with the stoker experiencing a drag force up to 28\% greater than the pilot. Furthermore, the application of a blockage correction for two athlete bodies in close proximity is investigated. Based on a large number of CFD simulations and validation with wind-tunnel measurements, this paper provides guidelines for the accurate CFD simulation of tandem aerodynamics.}

Further developments of a well-established model (1Dime code) are presented, with particular emphasis on combustion and scavenging processes simulation. The rate of heat release is computed through a two-zone model, based on a 'fractal representation of the turbulent flame front. A CAD procedure evaluating, at each crank-angle and flame radius, the intersections between the flame surface and the actual combustion chamber walls, has been developed. Scavenging is modeled through an original two-zone approach which accounts for mixing and short-circuiting processes. The latter are directly related to the in-cylinder turbulent flow regime, inlet and exhaust flow velocities, and engine speed. The main objective is a reduction of the number and the influence of the so-called tuning parameters, always necessarily present and crucial in any scavenging model. The simulation of the in-cylinder phenomena is coupled to the computation of the 1D flow in the external ducts, which is based on the employment of a finite volume, total variation diminishing (TVD) technique. The whole engine is described, starting from the air-cleaner box up to the exhaust tailpipe. The model also includes a procedure for the simulation of the reed valve dynamics. A number of comparisons with experimental data are presented with reference to instantaneous pressure data within the crankcase, the cylinder and the exhaust pipe in the whole engine operating range, including part-load conditions. The performance and emissions characteristics of the engine are also compared with overall test-bench data. The results presented demonstrate that this kind of model is competitive with more complex 1D-3D approaches.}

  abstract = {A parametric computational model of the human carotid artery bifurcation is employed to demonstrate that it is only necessary to simulate approximately one-half of a single heart pulse when performing a global exploration of the relationships between shear stress and changes in geometry. Using design of experiments and surface fitting techniques, a landscape is generated that graphically depicts these multi-dimensional relationships. Consequently, whilst finely resolved, grid and pulse independent results are traditionally demanded by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) community, this strategy demonstrates that it is possible to efficiently detect the relative impact of different geometry parameters, and to identify good and bad regions of the landscape by only simulating a fraction of a single pulse. Also, whereas in the past comparisons have been made between the distributions of appropriate shear stress metrics, such as average wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index, this strategy requires a figure of merit to compare different geometries. Here, an area-weighted integral of negative time-averaged shear stress, tau , is used as the principal objective function, although the discussion reveals that the extent as well as the intensity of reverse flow may be important. Five geometry parameters are considered: the sinus bulb width, the angles and the outflow diameters of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA). A survey of the landscape confirms that bulb shape has the dominant effect on tau with maximum tau occurring for large bulb widths. Also, it is shown that different sets of geometric parameters can produce low values of tau by either relatively small intense areas, or by larger areas of less intense reverse flow.},

Our objectives were to investigate the formation rates and growth patterns of gas hydrates in natural systems and to assess the geochemical stability of the reaction products over time. The novel experimental procedures used the carrying capacity, imaging capability, and control mechanisms of the ROV to transport gas cylinders to depth and to open valves selectively under desired P-T conditions to release the gas either into contained natural sea water or into sediments. In experiments in Monterey Bay, California, at 910 m depth and 3.9 \dbend C water temperature we find hydrate formation to be nearly instantaneous for a variety of gases. In sediments the pattern of hydrate formation is dependent on the pore size, with flooding of the pore spaces in a coarse sand yielding a hydrate cemented mass, and gas channeling in a fine-grained mud creating a veined hydrate structure. In experiments with liquid CO2 the released globules appeared to form a hydrate skin as they slowly rose in the apparatus. An initial attempt to leave the experimental material on the sea floor for an extended period was partially successful; we observed an apparent complete dissolution of the liquid CO2 mass, and an apparent consolidation of the CH4 hydrate, over a period of about 85 days.},

Spark shadow pictures showed that, for all ratios of densities in the two streams, the mixing layer is dominated by large coherent structures. High-speed movies showed that these convect at nearly constant speed, and increase their size and spacing discontinuously by amalgamation with neighbouring ones. The pictures and measurements of density fluctuations suggest that turbulent mixing and entrainment is a process of entanglement on the scale of the large structures; some statistical properties of the latter are used to obtain an estimate of entrainment rates. Large changes of the density ratio across the mixing layer were found to have a relatively small effect on the spreading angle; it is concluded that the strong effects, which are observed when one stream is supersonic, are due to compressibility effects, not density effects, as has been generally supposed.},

  abstract = {In the emerging field of multi-physics simulations, we often face the challenge to establish new connections between physical fields, to add additional aspects to existing models, or to exchange a solver for one of the involved physical fields. If in such cases a fast prototyping of a coupled simulation environment is required, a partitioned setup using existing codes for each physical field is the optimal choice. As accurate models require also accurate numerics, multi-physics simulations typically use very high grid resolutions and, accordingly, are run on massively parallel computers. Here, we face the challenge to combine flexibility with parallel scalability and hardware efficiency. In this paper, we present the coupling tool preCICE which offers the complete coupling functionality required for a fast development of a multi-physics environment using existing, possibly black-box solvers. We hereby restrict ourselves to bidirectional surface coupling which is too expensive to be done via file communication, but in contrast to volume coupling still a candidate for distributed memory parallelism between the involved solvers. The paper gives an overview of the numerical functionalities implemented in preCICE as well as the user interfaces, i.e., the application programming interface and configuration options. Our numerical examples and the list of different open-source and commercial codes that have already been used with preCICE in coupled simulations show the high flexibility, the correctness, and the high performance and parallel scalability of coupled simulations with preCICE as the coupling unit.},

In this work, we investigate the locations where hydrodynamic diffusion of RBCs occurs and the effects of stenosis severity on shear-induced diffusion (SID) of RBCs, concentration distribution and wall shear stress (WSS). For the first time, multiphase mixture theory approach with Phillips shear-induced diffusive flux model coupled with Quemada non-Newtonian viscosity model has been applied to numerically simulate the RBCs macroscopic behavior in four different degrees of stenosis (DOS) geometries, viz., 30\%, 50\%, 70\% and 85\%. Considering SID of RBCs, the calculated average WSS increased by 77.70\% which emphasises the importance of SID in predicting hemodynamic parameters. At the stenosis throat, it was observed that 85\% DOS model had the lowest concentration of RBCs near the wall and highest concentration at the center. For the stenosis models with 70\% and 85\% DOS, the RBC lumen wall concentration at the distal section of stenosis becomes inhomogeneous with the maximum fluctuation of 1.568\%. Finally, the wall regions with low WSS and low RBC concentrations correlate well with the atherosclerosis sites observed clinically.},

  abstract = {{$<$}jats:p{$>$}Cardiovascular disease often occurs with silent and gradual alterations of cardiac blood flow that can lead to the onset of chronic pathological conditions. Image-based patient-specific Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models allow for an extensive quantification of the flow field beyond the direct capabilities of medical imaging techniques that could support the clinicians in the early diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment planning of patients. Nonetheless, the large and impulsive kinematics of the left ventricle (LV) and the mitral valve (MV) pose relevant modeling challenges. Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods struggle with the complex 3D mesh handling of rapidly moving valve leaflets within the left ventricle (LV). We, therefore, developed a Chimera-based (overset meshing) method to build a patient-specific 3D CFD model of the beating LV which includes a patient-inspired kinematic model of the mitral valve (LVMV). Simulations were performed with and without torsion. In addition, to evaluate how the intracardiac LV flow is impacted by the MV leaflet kinematics, a third version of the model without the MV was generated (LV with torsion). For all model versions, six cardiac cycles were simulated. All simulations demonstrated cycle-to-cycle variations that persisted after six cycles but were albeit marginal in terms of the magnitude of standard deviation of velocity and vorticity which may be related to the dissipative nature of the numerical scheme used. The MV was found to have a crucial role in the development of the intraventricular flow by enhancing the direct flow, the apical washout, and the propagation of the inlet jet towards the apical region. Consequently, the MV is an essential feature in the patient-specific CFD modeling of the LV. The impact of torsion was marginal on velocity, vorticity, wall shear stress, and energy loss, whereas it resulted to be significant in the evaluation of particle residence times. Therefore, including torsion could be considered in patient-specific CFD models of the LV, particularly when aiming to study stasis and residence time. We conclude that, despite some technical limitations encountered, the Chimera technique is a promising alternative for ALE methods for 3D CFD models of the heart that include the motion of valve leaflets.{$<$}/jats:p{$>$}},

The results from these kinetic measurements were compared to those obtained from gas hydrate studies. The thermodynamic inhibitory nature of methanol was reflected in the findings as expected. However, some nucleation retardation was also observed at all concentrations studied, with higher concentrations of methanol resulting in ice formation. Addition of poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to THF/water mixtures caused nucleation times to increase and crystal growth to decelerate. No significant synergic effect was observed for THF hydrate inhibition using a combination of PVP and one of two glycol ethers, which were found to dramatically increase nucleation periods in natural gas hydrate formation. Only a slight synergic tendency was observed for the combination from the DSC results, while the Raman data gave no indication of a synergic effect for the combination. The results suggest that the nature of the guest species may be an important factor in the mechanism of hydrate inhibition.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess how 4D flow MRI-based pressure and energy loss estimates correspond to net transstenotic pressure gradients (TPGnet ) and their dependence on spatial resolution.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Numerical velocity data of stenotic flow were obtained from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations in geometries with varying stenosis degrees, poststenotic diameters and flow rates. MRI measurements were simulated at different spatial resolutions. The simplified and extended Bernoulli equations, Pressure-Poisson equation (PPE), and integration of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and viscous dissipation were compared against the true TPGnet .\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: The simplified Bernoulli equation overestimated the true TPGnet (8.74\,{$\pm$}\,0.67 versus 6.76\,{$\pm$}\,0.54 mmHg). The extended Bernoulli equation performed better (6.57\,{$\pm$}\,0.53 mmHg), although errors remained at low TPGnet . TPGnet estimations using the PPE were always close to zero. Total TKE and viscous dissipation correlated strongly with TPGnet for each geometry (r(2) \,{$>$}\,0.93) and moderately considering all geometries (r(2) \,=\,0.756 and r(2) \,=\,0.776, respectively). TKE estimates were accurate and minorly impacted by resolution. Viscous dissipation was overall underestimated and resolution dependent.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Several parameters overestimate or are not linearly related to TPGnet and/or depend on spatial resolution. Considering idealized axisymmetric geometries and in absence of noise, TPGnet was best estimated using the extended Bernoulli equation. Magn Reson Med, 2015. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

Due to the limitations of current cardiac imaging modalities, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been widely used for the purposes of cardiac function assessment and heart disease diagnosis, as they provide detailed insights into the cardiac flow field. An understanding of ventricular hemodynamics and pathological severities can be gained through studies that employ the CFD method. In this research the hemodynamics of two common myocardial diseases, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocardial infarction (MI) were investigated, during both the filling phase and the whole cardiac cycle, through a prescribed geometry and fluid structure interaction (FSI) approach. The results of the research indicated that early stage disease identification and the improvement of cardiac assisting devices and therapeutic procedures can be facilitated through the use of the CFD method.}

  abstract = {To model the F\aa hr\ae us\textendash Lindqvist effect, Haynes' marginal zone theory is used, following previous works, i.e., a core layer of uniform red blood cells (RBCs) is assumed to be surrounded by an annular plasma layer in which no RBCs are present. A simplified trial-and-error solution procedure is provided to determine the size of the core region and the hematocrit level in that zone in addition to the apparent viscosity, given the (upstream) large vessel hematocrit level and the average hematocrit level in the (downstream) small vessel. To test the model, a set of experimental data is selected to provide not only apparent viscosity data but also the average hematocrit levels in small tubes of different diameters. The results are found to support Haynes' marginal theory, with no fitting parameters used in the computations. Viscous dissipation is determined. The use of the mechanical energy balance is found to lead to results that are consistent with those based on the momentum balance, while leaving the average hematocrit level undetermined and required by either experimental data or an additional equation based on further theoretical work. The present analysis is used to model bifurcation using published empirical correlations quantifying the F\aa hr\ae us effect and phase separation.

  abstract = {Blood flow in micro capillaries of diameter approximately 15\textendash 500~{$\mu$}m is accompanied with a lower tube hematocrit level and lower apparent viscosity as the diameter decreases. These effects are termed the F\aa hraeus and F\aa hraeus\textendash Lindqvist effects, respectively. Both effects are linked to axial accumulation of red blood cells. In the present investigation, we extend previous works using a shear-induced model for the migration of red blood cells and adopt a model for blood viscosity that accounts for the suspending medium viscosity and local hematocrit level. For fully developed hematocrit profiles (i.e., independent of axial location), the diffusion fluxes due to particle collision frequency and viscosity gradients are of equal magnitude and opposite directions. The ratio of the diffusion coefficients for the two fluxes affects both the F\aa hraeus and F\aa hraeus\textendash Lindqvist effects and is found related to the capillary diameter and discharge hematocrit using a well-known data-fit correlation for apparent blood viscosity. The velocity and hematocrit profiles were determined numerically as functions of radial coordinate, tube diameter, and discharge hematocrit. The velocity profile determined numerically is consistent with the derived analytical expression and the results are in good agreement with published numerical results and experimental data for hematocrit ratio and hematocrit and velocity profiles.},

However, the haemodynamic conditions in hypertension models are poorly understood. This study aimed to observe the characteristics of haemodynamics in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and antihypertensive-treated SHRs. Twenty-four adult male SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) were randomly divided into four groups and treated for 7 days as follows: WKY-CON (WKYs\,+\,saline), WKY-NIF (WKYs\,+\,nifedipine, 50\,mg/kg/day), SHR-CON (SHRs\,+\,saline), and SHR-NIF (SHRs\,+\,nifedipine). Aortic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were simulated to obtain the haemodynamic parameters. We found that in the hypertensive (SHR-CON) and blood pressure-controlled (SHR-NIF) groups, the oscillatory shear index (OSI) and relative residence time (RRT), which are key haemodynamics indices, were markedly elevated. Furthermore, there was a correlation between both the elevated OSI and RRT with the vascular wall thickening in regions near the inner wall of the aortic arch. Our research demonstrates that haemodynamics remains disturbed even if the blood pressure is normalized. In addition, vascular remodelling may play an important role in maintaining elevated OSI and RRT values.},

The purpose of this paper is to verify a commercial software based fluid-structure interaction scheme for the left ventricular filling. The scheme applies the finite volume method to discretize the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid while using the nonlinear finite element method to model the structure. The coupling of the fluid and structure is implemented by combining the fluid and structure equations as a unified system and solving it simultaneously at every time step. The left ventricular filling flow in a three-dimensional ellipsoidal thin-wall model geometry of the human heart is simulated, based on a prescribed time-varying Young's modulus. The coupling converges smoothly though the deformation is very large. The pressure-volume relation of the model ventricle, the spatial and temporal distributions of pressure, transient velocity vectors as well as vortex patterns are analyzed, and they agree qualitatively and quantitatively well with the existing data. This preliminary study has verified the feasibility of the scheme and shown the possibility to simulate the left ventricular flow in a more realistic way by adding a myocardial constitutive law into the model and using a more realistic heart geometry.},

The objective of this study is to use computational fluid dynamics reconstructions of type B aortic dissections to compare geometric and haemodynamic factors between the cases selected for medical treatment and the cases selected for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), and to examine whether any of these factors are associated with the outcome of the medically treated group. This study includes eight type B dissection cases, with four in each group. Aortic flow analyses were carried out based on patient-specific anatomy at initial presentation before treatment. Comparisons between the two groups show that the false lumen to true lumen volume ratio is considerably higher in patients selected for TEVAR. Results from the four medically treated cases indicate that the size of the primary entry tear is the key determinant of the false lumen flow rate, which may influence the long-term outcome of medically treated patients. Potential relations between flow related parameters based on initial anatomy and subsequent anatomical changes in the medically treatment group were examined. Our initial findings based on the limited cases are that high relative residence time is a strong predictor of subsequent false lumen thrombosis, whereas pressure difference between the true and false lumen as well as the location of the largest pressure difference may be associated with the likelihood of subsequent aortic expansion.},

The purpose of this study is to elucidate if a healthy LV could harbour flow instabilities, using image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 35 cardiac cycles were simulated in a patient-specific left heart model obtained from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). The model includes the valves, atrium, ventricle, papillary muscles and ascending aorta. We computed phase-averaged flow patterns, fluctuating kinetic energy (FKE) and associated frequency components. The LV harbours disturbed flow during diastole with cycle-to-cycle variations. However, phase-averaged velocity fields much resemble those of CMR measurements and usually reported CFD results. The peak FKE value occurs during the E wave deceleration and reaches 25\% of the maximum phase-averaged flow kinetic energy. Highest FKE values are predominantly located in the basal region and their frequency content reach more than 200 Hz. This study suggests that high-frequency flow fluctuations in normal LV may be common, implying deficiencies in the hypothesis usually made when computing cardiac flows and highlighting biases when deriving quantities from velocity fields measured with CMR.},

In a regression analysis on data from an in vivo test in an 85 Kg male calf for 20 days, the PIT was found to have high correlation with the blood sac filling volume (R=0.883: left filling volume, R=0.967: right filling volume). A conceptual equation hypothesizing this correlation between PIT and filling volume was established based on the observation and the unknown parameters were identified using least squares parameter optimization. The estimation equation identified proved highly accurate (R=0.916 for left flow, R=0.970 for right flow). The accuracy of the estimation scheme promises very good practical applicability.

Accurate representations of ventricular geometry and fiber orientations are constructed from the structural magnetic resonance and the diffusion tensor MR images, respectively. The deformation of the ventricle obtained from the electromechanical model serves as input to the hemodynamics model in this one-way coupled approach via imposed kinematic wall velocity boundary conditions and at the same time, governs the blood flow into and out of the ventricular volume. The time-dependent endocardial surfaces are registered using a diffeomorphic mapping algorithm, while the intraventricular blood flow patterns are simulated using a sharp-interface immersed boundary method-based flow solver. The utility of the combined heart-function model is demonstrated by comparing the hemodynamic characteristics of a normal canine heart beating in sinus rhythm against that of the dyssynchronously beating failing heart.

In this article, a three-dimensional model of the Kyoto-NTN magnetically suspended centrifugal blood pump was generated and a computational fluid dynamics solution of the inner flow field of the pump including the static pressure distributions, velocity profiles, and the shear stress distributions of the blood was presented. The results revealed that reverse flow generally occurred in the impeller blade channels during the operation of the pump, due to the imbalance of the flow and the pressure gradient generated in the blade channels. The flow pattern at the exit of the blade channels was varying with its angular positions in the pump. The reverse flow at the exit of the impeller blade channels was found to be closely related with the static pressure distribution in the volute passage. Higher pressure in the volute caused severe backflow from the volute into the blade channels. To clarify the effects of a moving impeller on the blood, shear stresses of the blood in the pump were investigated according to the simulation results. The studies indicated that at the beginning of the splitter plate and the cutwater, the highest shear stress exceeded 700 Pa. At other regions such as the inlet and outlet of the impeller blade channels and some regions in the volute passage, shear stresses were found to be about 200 Pa. These areas are believed to have a high possibility of rendering blood trauma.},

We used the keywords, "CFD" and "aneurysms" to search recent publications since about 2000, and categorized them into (i) studies of rupture risk factors and (ii) investigations of pre- and post-evaluations of surgical treatment with devices like coils and flow diverters (FD). This search enables us to examine the current status of CFD as a clinical tool and to determine if CFD can potentially become an important part of the routine clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of aneurysms in near future. According to previous reports, it has been argued that CFD has become a quite robust non-invasive tool for the evaluation of surgical devices, especially in the early stages of device design and it has also been applied successfully to the study of rupture risk assessment. However, we find that due to the large number of pre-processing inputs further efforts of validation and reproducibility of CFD with larger clinical datasets are still essential to identify standardized mechanical risk factors. As a result, we identify the following needs to have a robust CFD tool for clinical use: (i) more reliability tests through validation studies, (ii) analyses of larger generalized clinical datasets to find converging universal risk parameters, (iii) fluid structure interaction (FSI) analyses to better understand the detailed vascular remodeling processes associated with aneurysm growth, evolution and rupture, and (iv) better coordinated and organized communications and collaborations between engineers and clinicians.},

  abstract = {Methane hydrate, equilibrated at P, T conditions within the hydrate stability field, was rapidly depressurized to 1.0 or 2.0 MPa and maintained at isobaric conditions outside its stability field, while the extent and rate of hydrate dissociation was measured at fixed, externally maintained temperatures between 250 and 288 K. The dissociation rate decreases with increasing pressure at a given temperature. Dissociation rates at 1.0 MPa parallel the complex, reproducible T-dependence previously observed between 250 and 272 K at 0.1 MPa. The lowest rates were observed near 268 K, such that {$>$}50\% of the sample can persist for more than two weeks at 0.1 MPa to more than a month at 1 and 2 MPa. Varying the pressure stepwise in a single experiment increased or decreased the dissociation rate in proportion to the rates observed in the isobaric experiments, similar to the rate reversibility previously observed with stepwise changes in temperature at 0.1 MPa. At fixed P, T conditions, the rate of methane hydrate dissociation decreases monotonically with time, never achieving a steady rate. The relationship between time (t) and the extent of hydrate dissociation is empirically described by: Evolved gas (\%) = A.t(B) (1) where the pre-exponential term A ranges from 0 to 16\% s(-B) and the exponent B is generally {$<$}1. Based on fits of the dissociation results to Equation I for the full range of temperatures (204 to 289 K) and pressures (0.1 to 2.0 MPa) investigated, the derived parameters can be used to predict the methane evolution curves for pure, porous methane hydrate to within +/-5\%. The effects of sample porosity and the presence of quartz sand and seawater on methane hydrate dissociation are also described using Equation 1.},

  abstract = {Validation studies are prerequisites for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to be accepted as part of clinical decision-making. This paper reports on the 2011 edition of the Virtual Intracranial Stenting Challenge. The challenge aimed to assess the reproducibility with which research groups can simulate the velocity field in an intracranial aneurysm, both untreated and treated with five different configurations of high-porosity stents. Particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurements were obtained to validate the untreated velocity field. Six participants, totaling three CFD solvers, were provided with surface meshes of the vascular geometry and the deployed stent geometries, and flow rate boundary conditions for all inlets and outlets. As output, they were invited to submit an abstract to the 8th International Interdisciplinary Cerebrovascular Symposium 2011 (ICS'11), outlining their methods and giving their interpretation of the performance of each stent configuration. After the challenge, all CFD solutions were collected and analyzed. To quantitatively analyze the data, we calculated the root-mean-square error (RMSE) over uniformly distributed nodes on a plane slicing the main flow jet along its axis and normalized it with the maximum velocity on the slice of the untreated case (NRMSE). Good agreement was found between CFD and PIV with a NRMSE of 7.28\%. Excellent agreement was found between CFD solutions, both untreated and treated. The maximum difference between any two groups (along a line perpendicular to the main flow jet) was 4.0 mm/s, i.e. 4.1\% of the maximum velocity of the untreated case, and the average NRMSE was 0.47\% (range 0.28-1.03\%). In conclusion, given geometry and flow rates, research groups can accurately simulate the velocity field inside an intracranial aneurysm-as assessed by comparison with in vitro measurements-and find excellent agreement on the hemodynamic effect of different stent configurations.},

The spatial distribution of the red blood cell volume fraction, hematocrit, is calculated from the velocity distribution. The hematocrit profiles provide direct measure of the thickness of the aggregation and shear rate dependent red blood cell depletion at the Couette surfaces. At the nominal shear rate studied hematocrit distributions for the red blood cells in plasma show a depletion zone near the inner Couette wall but not the outer wall. The red blood cells in plasma with Dextran show cell depletion regions of approximately 100 mum at both the inner and outer Couette surfaces, with greater depletion at the inner wall, but approach the normal blood hematocrit distribution with a doubling of shear rate due to decreased aggregation. The material response of the blood is spatially dependent with the shear rate and the hematocrit distribution non-uniform across the gap.},

  abstract = {Hydraulic mock circulatory systems have low flexibility to allow tests of different cardiovascular devices and low precision when a reference model must be reproduced. In this paper a new bench is described. It combines the computer model of the environment in which the device will operate and the electro-hydraulic interfaces by which device and computer are connected. A models library provided with basic functions allows implementing many layouts of the bench, which in turn depend both on the device properties and the desired experiment. In case of an apical L VAD evaluation, the bench can reproduce right and left ventricles, pulmonary and systemic circulations, inlet and outlet LVAD cannulas. An interface forces the instantaneous calculated flow at the VAD input and feeds back the measured pressure to the computer; another interface works in a similar but complementary- way at the VAD output. The paper focuses on the operating principle of the electro hydraulic interfaces which represent a relevant component of the bench, on the RT-Linuxbased software architecture, on the models of the basic elements of the bench. A patent is under preparation. At the moment, on I y a portion of the bench has been developed. It consists of a pistoncylinder mechanism, which mimics the elastance-based mechanism of a natural ventricle, and a hydraulic circuit representing the arterialload according to a modified windkessel model and the venous return according to the Guyton's model. The pump is driven by a real-time simulation of the cardiovascular system. This preliminary layout allowed testing the piston-cylinder mechanism, its control, and the software. This electro-hydraulic interface has been used to reproduce a pulsatile pump working in different modes. The hybrid model approach can support the development of new cardiac assist devices from their computer model to their manufacture.

  abstract = {Purpose of review: Recent advances in technology as well as new indications for implantation have appeared in the field of ventricular assist devices. Progress has also been made in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of myocardial recovery after ventricular assist device support. Recent findings: Technological progress includes the development of fully implantable pulsatile and continuous flow pumps, either axial flow or centrifugal, for left ventricular and total heart assistance. Among the new indications for ventricular assist device support, the most important is the use of the device as permanent treatment for end-stage cardiac failure patients. Increased knowledge has been acquired regarding the effects of mechanical assistance and of unloading of the heart on haemodynamics, as well as on the cellular, molecular and electrophysiological characteristics of the failing heart. All these findings suggest that depressed myocardial function can sometimes recover with ventricular assist device therapy. Ventricular assist device support, however, still carries a high rate of complications: the device itself can fail, bleeding and thromboembolism are common, immunity is disturbed and the incidence of infection remains high. Summary: In patients with end-stage heart failure, ventricular assist devices can be used as a bridge to transplantation or to recovery, but they are now also considered as a long-term myocardial replacement therapy. Which device is the most appropriate for each indication, however, remains to be defined. Even if the underlying mechanisms of myocardial recovery are progressively clarified, the use of ventricular assist devices as a bridge to recovery still has limited clinical success. Clinical trials with the fully implantable devices are in their early stages, but these pumps appear promising in terms of efficacy, reliability and complication rate, as well as being easy to implant. Because more patients will benefit from ventricular assist device placement in the future, anaesthesiologists must be prepared to manage patients undergoing ventricular assist device placement or presenting for noncardiac surgery while under ventricular assist device support.}

In this overview, we describe how the classical concept of arterial thrombus formation and vascular occlusion, driven by platelet activation and fibrin formation, can be extended and fine-tuned. This has become possible because of recent insight into the mechanisms of: (i) platelet-vessel wall and platelet-platelet communication, (ii) autocrine platelet activation, and (iii) platelet-coagulation interactions, in relation to blood flow dynamics. We list over 40 studies with genetically modified mice showing a role of platelet and plasma proteins in the control of thrombus stability after vascular injury. These include multiple platelet adhesive receptors and other junctional molecules, components of the ADP receptor signalling cascade to integrin activation, proteins controlling platelet shape, and autocrine activation processes, as well as multiple plasma proteins binding to platelets and proteins of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. Regulatory roles herein of the endothelium and other blood cells are recapitulated as well. Patient studies support the contribution of platelet- and coagulation activation in the regulation of thrombus stability. Analysis of the factors determining flow-dependent thrombus stabilization and embolus formation in mice will help to understand the regulation of this process in human arterial disease.},

The actuators are manufactured by bonding piezoelectric material to an inert substrate to control the bleed/suction rate through a plenum chamber. The cavity allows rapid thickening of the boundary-layer approaching the shock, which splits into a series of weaker shocks forming a lambda shock foot, thus reducing wave drag. Active control allows optimisation of the interaction, as it would be capable of either positioning the control region around the original shock position using a series of unimorph flaps or fixing the shock position by controlling the rate of mass transfer.The level of control achieved by unimorph piezoelectric actuators is not large because of small amounts of deflection possible. It is believed that to provide optimal control a piezoelectric material, which can provide greater strain and hence higher amounts of deflection is needed. However, currently such a piezoelectric material is not commercially available.},

  abstract = {Although mathematical modelling of pressure-flow dynamics in the cardiocirculatory system has a lengthy history, readily finding the appropriate model for the experimental situation at hand is often a challenge in and of itself. An ideal model would be relatively easy to use and reliable, besides being ethically acceptable. Furthermore, it would address the pathogenic features of the cardiovascular disease that one seeks to investigate. No universally valid model has been identified, even though a host of models have been developed. The object of this review is to describe several of the most relevant mathematical models of the cardiovascular system: the physiological features of circulatory dynamics are explained, and their mathematical formulations are compared. The focus is on the whole-body scale mathematical models that portray the subject's responses to hypovolemic shock. The models contained in this review differ from one another, both in the mathematical methodology adopted and in the physiological or pathological aspects described. Each model, in fact, mimics different aspects of cardiocirculatory physiology and pathophysiology to varying degrees: some of these models are geared to better understand the mechanisms of vascular hemodynamics, whereas others focus more on disease states so as to develop therapeutic standards of care or to test novel approaches. We will elucidate key issues involved in the modeling of cardiovascular system and its control by reviewing seven of these models developed to address these specific purposes.},

Experimental results are in good agreement with available data, and concord well with predictions computed using the model of Van der Waals and Platteeuw (1959).

  abstract = {Hematocrit distribution and red blood cell aggregation are the major determinants of blood flow in narrow tubes at low flow rates. It has been observed experimentally that in microcirculation the hematocrit distribution is not uniform. This nonuniformity may result from plasma skimming and cell screening effects and also from red cell sedimentation. The goal of the present study is to understand the effect of nonaxisymmetric hematocrit distribution on the flow of human and cat blood in small blood vessels of the microcirculation. Blood vessels are modeled as circular cylindrical tubes. Human blood is described by Quemada's rheological model, in which local viscosity is a function of both the local hematocrit and a structural parameter that is related to the size of red blood cell aggregates. Cat blood is described by Casson's model. Eccentric hematocrit distribution is considered such that the axis of the cylindrical core region of red cell suspension is parallel to the axis of the blood vessel but not coincident. The problem is solved numerically by using finite element method. The calculations predict nonaxisymmetric distribution of velocity and shear stress in the blood vessel and the increase of apparent viscosity with increasing eccentricity of the core.},

  title = {Rheology of Concentrated Suspensions and Shear-Induced Migration},
  author = {Dbouk, Talib},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {This thesis deals with an experimental and numerical investigation of the phenomenon of shear-induced particle migration in inhomogeneous shear flows of mono-dispersed non-colloidal suspensions at neglected inertia. Variety of diffusion flux models that predict the shear-induced migration were presented. However, in this work, the Suspension Balance Model (SBM) is adopted. The latter describes the migration flux of particles as the divergence of the particle Stress tensor. According to the need for the different measurable parameters in this Model, a new experiment was developed for measuring the viscosity, the two Normal Stress Differences and the particle stress tensor of mono-dispersed non-Brownian suspensions of hard spheres flowing between rotating parallel disks over a wide range of concentrations (0.20 - 0.46). The original SBM is modified based on the new measurements. The Finite Volume Method via the OpenFOAM package is used as the technique to solve the problem numerically. Solutions are generated and results are compared to similar ones generated with the original model. Finally,the SBM model is extended into two-dimensional situations within a general Frame-Invariant structure that takes into account the local kinematics of the suspension. Lorsqu'une suspension concentr\'ee est en \'ecoulement, il est fr\'equent d'observer que la concentration en particules ne reste pas homog\`ene mais que les particules migrent vers des r\'egions pr\'ef\'erentielles de l'\'ecoulement. Globalement, il existe deux types de mod\`eles pour d\'ecrire cette interaction entre l'\'ecoulement et la structure qui appara\^it dans la suspension. Les premiers sont assez ph\'enom\'enologiques et reposent sur l'\'etude des collisions qui surviennent entre les particules en \'ecoulement. Ils donnent lieu \`a une description de la migration en terme de diffusion des particules. Le second mod\`ele, appel\'e "Suspension Balance Model" (SBM), fait appel \`a l'action des contraintes normales d'origine particulaire engendr\'ees par l'\'ecoulement. Ce mod\`ele semble tr\`es pertinent mais son utilisation souffre du manque de donn\'ees sur les contraintes normales dans les suspensions. Ce manuscrit rapporte une \'etude exp\'erimentale et num\'erique de la rh\'eologie et de la migration induite par un \'ecoulement dans des suspensions non-browniennes concentres. La partie exp\'erimentale consiste \`a mesurer, en g\'eom\'etrie torsionnelle plan-plan, la viscosit\'e, les deux diff\'erences de contraintes normales et le tenseur des contraintes particulaires. Les contraintes particulaires d\'etermin\'ees exp\'erimentalement sont alors inject\'ees dans le "Suspension Balance Model" qui relie le flux de particules \`a la divergence du tenseur des contraintes particulaires, dans le cas d'un \'ecoulement de cisaillement simple. Les \'equations coupl\'ees de la conservation de la masse, des particules et du moment d'inertie sont impl\'ement\'ees dans OpenFOAM et r\'esolues par la m\'ethode des volumes finis. Les r\'esultats num\'eriques sont compar\'es \`a des r\'esultats num\'eriques et exp\'erimentaux de la litt\'erature. Enfin, le SBM est g\'en\'eralis\'e pour \^etre utilis\'e dans tout type d'\'ecoulement \`a 2 dimensions ; les cas du cisaillement d'un nuage de particules et de l'effet de la gravit\'e dans un \'ecoulement de Couette horizontal sont trait\'es.},

Mechanisms of fluid drag in turbulent flow and riblet-drag reduction theories from experiment and simulation are discussed. A review of riblet-performance studies is given, and optimal riblet geometries are defined. A survey of studies experimenting with riblet-topped shark-scale replicas is also given. A method for selecting optimal riblet dimensions based on fluid-flow characteristics is detailed, and current manufacturing techniques are outlined. Due to the presence of small amounts of mucus on the skin of a shark, it is expected that the localized application of hydrophobic materials will alter the flow field around the riblets in some way beneficial to the goals of increased drag reduction.},

Substituting a linearized model of the structural solver into the flow solver makes the coupling more stable but is impracticable if the flow solver is a black box.

METHODS: Computer simulation was used to perform this study. Lumped parameter models reproduce the circulatory system. Variable elastance models reproduce the Starling's law of the heart for each ventricle. After the reproduction of ischemic heart disease left ventricular assistance was applied using a model of rotary blood pump. The pump speed was changed in steps and was assumed to be constant during each step. The influence of mechanical ventilation was introduced by different values of positive mean thoracic pressure. RESULTS: The increase of the rotational speed has a significant influence on some ventricular energetic variables. In fact it decreased left ventricular external work, left and right ventricular pressure-volume area and the left ventricular efficiency. Finally, it increased the right ventricular efficiency but had no influence on the right ventricular external work. The increase of thoracic pressure from -2 to +5 mmHg caused a significant decrease of external work, pressure-volume area (right ventricular pressure-volume area dropped up to 50\%) and an increase of right ventricular efficiency (by 40\%) while left ventricular efficiency remained almost stable. CONCLUSIONS: Numerical simulation is a very suitable tool to predict changes of not easily measurable parameters such as energetic ventricular variables when mechanical assistance of heart and/or lungs is applied independently or simultaneously.}

Here, the term biofuel is referred to as liquid or gaseous fuels for the transport sector that are predominantly produced from biomass. There are several reasons for biofuels to be considered as relevant technologies by both developing and industrialized countries. They include energy security reasons, environmental concerns, foreign exchange savings, and socioeconomic issues related to the rural sector. The term modern biomass is generally used to describe the traditional biomass use through the efficient and clean combustion technologies and sustained supply of biomass resources, environmentally sound and competitive fuels, heat and electricity using modern conversion technologies. Modern biomass can be used for the generation of electricity and heat. Bioethanol and biodiesel as well as diesel produced from biomass by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis are the most modern biomass-based transportation fuels. Bio-ethanol is a petrol additive/substitute. It is possible that wood, straw and even household wastes may be economically converted to bio-ethanol. Bio-ethanol is derived from alcoholic fermentation of sucrose or simple sugars, which are produced from biomass by hydrolysis process. Currently crops generating starch, sugar or oil are the basis for transport fuel production. There has been renewed interest in the use of vegetable oils for making biodiesel due to its less polluting and renewable nature as against the conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Biodiesel is a renewable replacement to petroleum-based diesel. Biomass energy conversion facilities are important for obtaining bio-oil. Pyrolysis is the most important process among the thermal conversion processes of biomass. Brief summaries of the basic concepts involved in the thermochemical conversions of biomass fuels are presented. The percentage share of biomass was 62.1 \% of the total renewable energy sources in 1995. The reduction of greenhouse gases pollution is the main advantage of utilizing biomass energy.

Methane was the dominant component among other hydrocarbon gases in the sediments. Gas hydrates, potentially one of the most important energy resources for the future. Methane gas hydrates are increasingly considered a potential energy resource. Enormous reserves of hydrates can be found under continental shelves and on land under permafrost. Gas hydrate or clathrate consists of three general structure types. Depending on the size of the guest molecule, natural gas hydrates can consist of any combination of three crystal structures: (1) Structure 1 or sl, (2) Structure II or all and (3) Structure H or sH. When pure liquid water freezes it crystallizes with hexagonal symmetry, but when it ``freezes\{''\} as a hydrocarbon hydrate it does so with cubic symmetry for sl and all, reverting to hexagonal symmetry for sH. Methane hydrates are widespread in sea sediments hundreds of meters below the sea floor along the outer continental margins and are also found in Arctic permafrost. Some deposits are close to the ocean floor and at water depths as shallow as 150 m, although at low latitudes they are generally only found below 500 m. The deposits can be 300-600 m thick and cover large horizontal areas. Hydrates may affect climate because when warmed or depressurized, they decompose and dissociate into water and methane gas, one of the greenhouse gases that warms the planet. Methane is a greenhouse gas. Discharge of large amounts of methane into the atmosphere would cause global warming. Methane hydrates hold the danger of natural hazards associated with sea floor stability, release of methane to ocean and atmosphere and gas hydrates disturbed during drilling pose a safety problem.

It relies on detailed experimental investigations on the fluid flow and the structure deformation using modern optical measurement techniques such as particle-image velocimetry and laser triangulation sensors. The present numerical study is based on an efficient partitioned FSI coupling scheme especially developed for turbulent flow simulations around light-weight structures using large-eddy simulation. The current FSI configuration is composed of a fixed cylinder with a flexible thin rubber plate and a rear mass inducing a turbulent flow (Re = 30,470). Mainly based on a movement-induced excitation the flexible structure oscillates in the second swiveling mode involving large deformations. Thus, particular attention has been paid to the computational model and the numerical set-up. Special seven-parameters shell elements are applied to precisely model the flexible structure. Structural tests are carried out to approximate the optimal structural parameters. A fine and smooth fluid mesh has been generated in order to correctly predict the wide range of different flow structures presents near and behind the flexible rubber plate. A phase-averaging is applied to the numerical results obtained, so that they can be compared with the phase-averaged experimental data. Both are found to be in close agreement exhibiting a structure deformation in the second swiveling mode with similar frequencies and amplitudes. Finally, a sensitivity study is carried out to show the influence of different physical parameters (e.g. Young's modulus) and modeling aspects (e.g. subgrid-scale model) on the FSI phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The objective of the present paper is to provide a challenging and well-defined validation test case for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in turbulent flow to close a gap in the literature. The following list of requirements are taken into account during the definition and setup phase. First, the test case should be geometrically simple which is realized by a classical cylinder flow configuration extended by a flexible structure attached to the backside of the cylinder. Second, clearly defined operating and boundary conditions are a must and put into practice by a constant inflow velocity and channel walls. The latter are also evaluated against a periodic setup relying on a subset of the computational domain. Third, the material model should be widely used. Although a rubber plate is chosen as the flexible structure, it is demonstrated by additional structural tests that a classical St. Venant-Kirchhoff material model is sufficient to describe the material behavior appropriately. Fourth, the flow should be in the turbulent regime. Choosing water as the working fluid and a medium-size water channel, the resulting Reynolds number of Re = 30 , 470 guarantees a sub-critical cylinder flow with transition taking place in the separated shear layers. Fifth, the test case results should be underpinned by a detailed validation process. Methods: For this purpose complementary numerical and experimental investigations were carried out. Based on optical contactless measuring techniques (particle-image velocimetry and laser distance sensor) the phase-averaged flow field and the structural deformations were determined. These data were compared with corresponding numerical predictions relying on large-eddy simulations and a recently developed semi-implicit predictor-corrector FSI coupling scheme. Outcome: Both results were found to be in close agreement showing a quasi-periodic oscillating flexible structure in the first swiveling FSI mode with a corresponding Strouhal number of about St FSI = 0.11 .},

  abstract = {Personalized computational hemodynamics (CH) is a promising tool to clarify/predict the link between low density lipoproteins (LDL) transport in aorta, disturbed shear and atherogenesis. However, CH uses simplifying assumptions that represent sources of uncertainty. In particular, modelling blood-side to wall LDL transfer is challenged by the cumbersomeness of protocols needed to obtain reliable LDL concentration profile estimations. This paucity of data is limiting the establishment of rigorous CH protocols able to balance the trade-offs among the variety of in vivo data to be acquired, and the accuracy required by biological/clinical applications. In this study, we analyze the impact of LDL concentration initialization (initial conditions, ICs) and inflow boundary conditions (BCs) on CH models of LDL blood-to-wall transfer in aorta. Technically, in an image-based model of human aorta, two different inflow BCs are generated imposing subject-specific inflow 3D PC-MRI measured or idealized (flat) velocity profiles. For each simulated BC, four different ICs for LDL concentration are applied, imposing as IC the LDL distribution resulting from steady-state simulations with average conditions, or constant LDL concentration values. Based on CH results, we conclude that: (1) the imposition of realistic 3D velocity profiles as inflow BC reduces the uncertainty affecting the representation of LDL transfer; (2) different LDL concentration ICs lead to markedly different patterns of LDL transfer. Given that it is not possible to verify in vivo the proper LDL concentration initialization to be applied, we suggest to carefully set and unambiguously declare the imposed BCs and LDL concentration IC when modelling LDL transfer in aorta, in order to obtain reproducible and ultimately comparable results among different laboratories.}

  abstract = {Aneurysms are abnormalities formed in some regions of the human vascular system and are characterized by dilated and thin regions of the arterial wall. One of the most common types occurs inside the brain arteries in the so-called circle of Willis. These intracranial aneurysms are extremely dangerous, because in case of rupture they can cause sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, with consequent death or presence of permanent damage to the patient. Causes of aneurysms have been investigated for a long time, and researchers agree that hemodynamic effects play a key role in the formation, growth, and rupture of brain aneurysms. However, the experimental procedures to better understand the characteristics of blood flow within the aneurysm are still difficult to perform. With the development of scanning techniques of the cerebral vascular system, it has been possible to obtain the geometry of aneurysms and then with that numerical methods for the solution of blood flow have begun to be used. Since then, several researchers have been investigating the influence of biological and hemodynamic variables on aneurysms rupture. However, it has been only in the last decade that the influence of fluid-structure interaction, due to the flexibility of the artery wall, on those variables has been investigated. In this context and using patient-specific aneurysm geometries, we simulated the blood flow using the opensource library foam-extend, which uses a partitioned methodology to numerically solve the fluid-structure interaction problem. By comparing the parameters that can lead to rupture \textendash{} wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index \textendash{} between the results of the simulations considering the rigid and flexible walls hypotheses, we evaluated the influence of wall flexibility on such parameters, concluding that the flexibility influences the parameters that can lead to rupture, changing the decision of treatment if made using those parameters.},

  abstract = {The ApoE-/- mouse is a common small animal model to study atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the large and medium sized arteries such as the carotid artery. It is generally accepted that the wall shear stress, induced by the blood flow, plays a key role in the onset of this disease. Wall shear stress, however, is difficult to derive from direct in vivo measurements, particularly in mice. In this study, we integrated in vivo imaging (micro-Computed Tomography-\textmu CT and ultrasound) and fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) modeling for the mouse-specific assessment of carotid hemodynamics and wall shear stress. Results were provided for 8 carotid bifurcations of 4 ApoE-/- mice. We demonstrated that accounting for the carotid elasticity leads to more realistic flow waveforms over the complete domain of the model due to volume buffering capacity in systole. The 8 simulated cases showed fairly consistent spatial distribution maps of time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and relative residence time (RRT). Zones with reduced TAWSS and elevated RRT, potential indicators of atherosclerosis-prone regions, were located mainly at the outer sinus of the external carotid artery. In contrast to human carotid hemodynamics, no flow recirculation could be observed in the carotid bifurcation region.},

  abstract = {Background Low and oscillatory wall shear stresses (WSS) near aortic bifurcations have been linked to the onset of atherosclerosis. In previous work, we calculated detailed WSS patterns in the carotid bifurcation of mice using a Fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) approach. We subsequently fed the animals a high-fat diet and linked the results of the FSI simulations to those of atherosclerotic plaque location on a within-subject basis. However, these simulations were based on boundary conditions measured under anesthesia, while active mice might experience different hemodynamics. Moreover, the FSI technique for mouse-specific simulations is both time- and labor-intensive, and might be replaced by simpler and easier Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The goal of the current work was (i) to compare WSS patterns based on anesthesia conditions to those representing active resting and exercising conditions; and (ii) to compare WSS patterns based on FSI simulations to those based on steady-state and transient CFD simulations. Methods For each of the 3 computational techniques (steady state CFD, transient CFD, FSI) we performed 5 simulations: 1 for anesthesia, 2 for conscious resting conditions and 2 more for conscious active conditions. The inflow, pressure and heart rate were scaled according to representative in vivo measurements obtained from literature. Results When normalized by the maximal shear stress value, shear stress patterns were similar for the 3 computational techniques. For all activity levels, steady state CFD led to an overestimation of WSS values, while FSI simulations yielded a clear increase in WSS reversal at the outer side of the sinus of the external carotid artery that was not visible in transient CFD-simulations. Furthermore, the FSI simulations in the highest locomotor activity state showed a flow recirculation zone in the external carotid artery that was not present under anesthesia. This recirculation went hand in hand with locally increased WSS reversal. Conclusions Our data show that FSI simulations are not necessary to obtain normalized WSS patterns, but indispensable to assess the oscillatory behavior of the WSS in mice. Flow recirculation and WSS reversal at the external carotid artery may occur during high locomotor activity while they are not present under anesthesia. These phenomena might thus influence plaque formation to a larger extent than what was previously assumed.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. Complex hemodynamics play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis and the processes of aging, as well as many other disease processes. Biofluid mechanics play a major role in the cardiovascular system and it is important to understand the forces and movement of blood cells and whole blood as well as the interaction between blood cells and the vessel wall. Fundamental fluid mechanical, which are important for the understanding of the blood flow in the cardiovascular circulatory system of the human body aspects are presented. Measurement techniques for model studies such as LDA, ultrasound, and MRI studies will be discussed. Viscosity and flow behavior changes specifically the creation of vortices and flow disturbances can be used to show how medication can influence flow behavior. Experiments have shown that hemodynamics may have a strong influence on the creation of aneurysms and varicose veins. Other factors such as vessel wall structure are also important. In preliminary studies, it has been demonstrated that geometry and elasticity of vessel walls help determine flow behavior. High velocity fluctuations indicate flow disturbances that should be avoided. Health care practitioners must understand fluid dynamic factors such as flow rate ratio, pressure and velocity gradients, and flow behavior, velocity distribution, shear stress on the wall and on blood cells. These mechanical factors are largely responsible for the deposit of blood cells and lipids, a leading cause of atherosclerosis. The interaction between blood cells and of the cells with the vessel, leads to the formation of plaques and agglomerations. These deposits are found predominantly at arterial bends and bifurcations where blood flow is disturbed, where a secondary flow is created, and where flow separation regions are found. Experiments on hemodynamic effects in elastic silicon rubber models of the cardiovascular system with flow wire, stents, or patches for vessel surgery will be discussed. These studies can be important in improving diagnostics and therapeutic applications. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}

Non invasive measurements of the radial BP waveform (MILLAR tonometry) were compared to those constructed by an electric simulator reproducing the model in a symmetrical network subdivided into 121 segments. We introduced at cardiac level the aortic stroke volume (Doppler echocardiography) and the dynamic values of compliance (relation of compliance-to pressure, constant or variable) whether the model was linear or non linear, measured by high resolution Doppler (NIUS 02) for each subject. RESULTS: At the radial artery segment the modelled BP obtained by the non linear model of AC was not significantly different from the measured BP wave, while in the linear model (AC constant at mean BP level) the systolic BP was significantly underestimated. (*P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: This work shows the limits inherent in simplification of arterial compliance in the Windkessel model using constant parameters. This demonstrates the influence of the dynamic properties of the arterial wall in a conduction artery on the level of systolic and diastolic BP.}

  abstract = {Although being small compared to inertial acceler- ation, viscous component of the pressure gradient has recently emerged as a potential biomarker for aortic disease conditions including aortic valve stenosis. However, as it involves the computation of second order derivatives and viscous dissipation is locally higher in the near-wall region of the larger vessels, where the lowest local signal-to-noise ratios are encountered, the estimation process from medical image velocity data through mathematical models is highly challenging. We propose a fully automatic framework to recover the laminar viscous pressure gradient through reconstruction of the velocity vector field in the aortic boundary region. An in-silico study is conducted and the pressure drop is computed solving a Poisson problem on pressure using both a reconstructed and non-reconstructed velocity profile near the vessel walls, showing a global improve- ment of performance with the enhanced method.}

Currently, measurements of pressure differences in the clinic rely on invasive techniques (catheterization), prompting development of non-invasive estimates based on blood flow. In this work, we propose a non-invasive estimation procedure deriving pressure difference from the work-energy equation for a Newtonian fluid. Spatial and temporal convergence is demonstrated on in silico Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Image (PC-MRI) phantoms with steady and transient flow fields. The method is also tested on an image dataset generated in silico from a 3D patient-specific Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation and finally evaluated on a cohort of 9 subjects. The performance is compared to existing approaches based on steady and unsteady Bernoulli formulations as well as the pressure Poisson equation. The new technique shows good accuracy, robustness to noise, and robustness to the image segmentation process, illustrating the potential of this approach for non-invasive pressure difference estimation.},

  abstract = {Recently, various non-invasive tools such as the Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI), Ultrasound Imaging (USI), Computed Tomography (CT), and the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) have been widely utilized to enhance our current understanding of the physiological parameters that affect the initiation and the progression of the cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) associated with heart failure (HF). In particular, the hemodynamics of Left ventricle (LV) has attracted the attention of the researchers due to its significant role in the heart functionality. In this study, CFD owing its capability of predicting detailed flow field was adopted to model the blood flow in images-based patient-specific LV over cardiac cycle. In most published studies, the blood is modeled as Newtonian that is not entirely accurate as the blood viscosity varies with the shear rate in non-linear manner. In this paper, we studied the effect of Newtonian assumption on the degree of accuracy of intraventricular hemodynamics. In doing so, various non-Newtonian models and Newtonian model are used in the analysis of the intraventricular flow and the viscosity of the blood. Initially, we used the cardiac MRI images to reconstruct the time-resolved geometry of the patient-specific LV. After the unstructured mesh generation, the simulations were conducted in the CFD commercial solver FLUENT to analyze the intraventricular hemodynamic parameters. The findings indicate that the Newtonian assumption cannot adequately simulate the flow dynamic within the LV over the cardiac cycle, which can be attributed to the pulsatile and recirculation nature of the flow and the low blood shear rate.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death today, incorporates a wide range of cardiovascular system malfunctions that affect heart functionality. It is believed that the hemodynamic loads exerted on the cardiovascular system, the left ventricle (LV) in particular, are the leading cause of CVD initiation and propagation. Moreover, it is believed that the diagnosis and prognosis of CVD at an early stage could reduce its high mortality and morbidity rate. Therefore, a set of robust clinical cardiovascular assessment tools has been introduced to compute the cardiovascular hemodynamics in order to provide useful insights to physicians to recognize indicators leading to CVD and also to aid the diagnosis of CVD. Recently, a combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and different medical imaging tools, image-based CFD (IB-CFD), has been widely employed for cardiovascular functional assessment by providing reliable hemodynamic parameters. Even though the capability of CFD to provide reliable flow dynamics in general fluid mechanics problems has been widely demonstrated for many years, up to now, the clinical implications of the IB-CFD patient-specific LVs have not been applicable due to its limitations and complications. In this paper, we review investigations conducted to numerically simulate patient-specific human LV over the past 15~years using IB-CFD methods. Firstly, we divide different studies according to the different LV types (physiological and different pathological conditions) that have been chosen to reconstruct the geometry, and then discuss their contributions, methodologies, limitations, and findings. In this regard, we have studied CFD simulations of intraventricular flows and related cardiology insights, for (i) Physiological patient-specific LV models, (ii) Pathological heart patient-specific models, including myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Finally, we discuss the current stage of the IB-CFD LV simulations in order to mimic realistic hemodynamics of patient-specific LVs. We can conclude that heart flow simulation is on the right track for developing into a useful clinical tool for heart function assessment, by (i) incorporating most of heart structures' (such as heart valves) operations, and (ii) providing useful diagnostic indices based hemodynamic parameters, for routine adoption in clinical usage.},

The basic questions addressed are dynamic stability and response of fluid structural systems as revealed by both linear and nonlinear mathematical models and correlation with experiment. The use of scaled models and full scale experiments and tests play a key role where theory is not considered sufficiently reliable. In this new edition the more recent literature on nonlinear aeroelasticity has been brought up to date and the opportunity has been taken to correct the inevitable typographical errors that the authors and our readers have found to date. The early chapters of this book may be used for a first course in aeroelasticity taught at the senior undergraduate or early graduate level and the later chapters may serve as the basis for a more advanced course, a graduate research seminar or as reference to provide an entree to the current research literature.},

  abstract = {We describe here a rigorous and accurate model for the simulation of three-dimensional deformable particles (DPs). The method is very versatile, easily simulating various types of deformable particles such as vesicles, capsules, and biological cells. Each DP is resolved explicitly and advects within the surrounding Newtonian fluid. The DPs have a preferred rest shape (e.g., spherical for vesicles, or biconcave for red blood cells). The model uses a classic hybrid system: an Eulerian approach is used for the Navier-Stokes solver (the lattice Boltzmann method) and a Lagrangian approach for the evolution of the DP mesh. Coupling is accomplished through the lattice Boltzmann velocity field, which transmits force to the membranes of the DPs. The novelty of this method resides in its ability (by design) to simulate a large number of DPs within the bounds of current computational limitations: our simple and efficient approach is to (i) use the lattice Boltzmann method because of its acknowledged efficiency at low Reynolds number and its ease of parallelization, and (ii) model the DP dynamics using a coarse mesh (approximately 500 nodes) and a spring model constraining (if necessary) local area, total area, cell volume, local curvature, and local primary stresses. We show that this approach is comparable to the more common - yet numerically expensive - approach of membrane potential function, through a series of quantitative comparisons. To demonstrate the capabilities of the model, we simulate the flow of 200 densely packed red blood cells - a computationally challenging task. The model is very efficient, requiring of the order of minutes for a single DP in a 50 microm x 40 microm x 40 microm simulation domain and only hours for 200 DPs in 80 microm x 30 microm x 30 microm . Moreover, the model is highly scalable and efficient compared to other models of blood cells in flow, making it an ideal and unique tool for studying blood flow in microvessels or vesicle or capsule flow (or a mixture of different particles). In addition to directly predicting fluid dynamics in complex suspension in any geometry, the model allows determination of accurate, empirical rules which may improve existing macroscopic, continuum models.},

The elastic moduli of saturated sediment are calculated from those of the dry frame using Gassmann's equation. Unlike the suspension model, our model assigns non-zero elastic constants to the dry-sediment frame and can predict the shear-wave velocity. Unlike various modifications of the traveltime-average equation, it is first-principle-based and contains only physical parameters. We justify this model by matching sonic data in shallow marine sediments and in an ODP well.},

Twenty blood samples from healthy donors were used to measure the whole blood viscosity under different values of the shear rates, which are between 2.25 and 450.0 s-1. The shear rate viscosity curves were used to calculate n (flow index) and m (the consistency of the fluid) according to the power law model. Strong correlations (R2 {$>$} 0.5) between m and the hematocrit (HCT \%), hemoglobin (Hb), erythrocytes count (RBC), mean corpuscle volume (MCV), and mean corpuscle hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were obtained. Strong correlations (R2 {$>$} 0.5) between n and the RBC, MCV, and MCHC were achieved. The relation obtained between the power law coefficients and the blood parameters in the present investigation provides new parameters that can be used to evaluate the flow state of blood besides blood viscosity. In addition, these parameters may be used to examine blood under pathological conditions, representing a new tool for the diagnosis of blood abnormal conditions.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Patients with mild heart failure (HF) who are clinically compensated may have normal left ventricular (LV) stroke volume (SV). Despite this, altered intra-ventricular flow patterns have been recognized in these subjects. We hypothesized that, compared with normal LVs, flow in myopathic LVs would demonstrate a smaller proportion of inflow volume passing directly to ejection and diminished the end-diastolic preservation of the inflow kinetic energy (KE).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (49 {$\pm$} 14 years, six females) and 10 healthy subjects (44 {$\pm$} 17 years, four females), four-dimensional MRI velocity and morphological data were acquired. A previously validated method was used to separate the LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) into four flow components based on the blood's locations at the beginning and end of the cardiac cycle. KE was calculated over the cardiac cycle for each component. The EDV was larger (P = 0.021) and the ejection fraction smaller (P {$<$} 0.001) in DCM compared with healthy subjects; the SV was equivalent (DCM: 77 {$\pm$} 19, healthy: 79 {$\pm$} 16 mL). The proportion of the total LV inflow that passed directly to ejection was smaller in DCM (P = 0.000), but the end-diastolic KE/mL of the direct flow was not different in the two groups (NS).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Despite equivalent LVSVs, HF patients with mild LV remodelling demonstrate altered diastolic flow routes through the LV and impaired preservation of inflow KE at pre-systole compared with healthy subjects. These unique flow-specific changes in the flow route and energetics are detectable despite clinical compensation, and may prove useful as subclinical markers of LV dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Storage of CO(2) in natural gas hydrate reservoirs may offer stable long term deposition of a greenhouse gas while benefiting from methane production, without requiring heat. By exposing hydrate to a thermodynamically preferred hydrate former, CO(2), the hydrate may be maintained macroscopically in the solid state and retain the stability of the formation. One of the concerns, however, is the flow capacity in such reservoirs. This in turn depends on three factors; 1) thermodynamic destabilization of hydrate in small pores due to capillary effects, 2) the presence of liquid channels separating the hydrate from the mineral surfaces and 3) the connectivity of gas-or liquid filled pores and channels. This paper reports experimental results of CH(4)-CO(2) exchange within sandstone pores and measurements of gas permeability during stages of hydrate growth in sandstone core plugs. Interactions between minerals and surrounding molecules are also discussed. The formation of methane hydrate in porous media was monitored and quantified with magnetic resonance imaging techniques (MRI). Hydrate growth pattern within the porous rock is discussed along with measurements of gas permeability at various hydrate saturations. Gas permeability was measured at steady state flow of methane through the hydrate- bearing core sample. Experiments on CO(2) injection in hydrate- bearing sediments was conducted in a similar fashion. By use of MRI and an experimental system designed for precise and stabile pressure and temperature controls flow of methane and CO(2) through the sandstone core proved to be possible for hydrate saturations exceeding 60\%.

The shape of a three dimensional vortex ring represents the axisymmetry of propulsion, which has applications in animal locomotion (e.g., the free-swimming of a jellyfish), rocket and marine propulsion devices as well as blood flow through the heart valves. No fluid dynamics' measure is yet defined to quantify the axisymmetry of a three dimensional vortex ring with a single value. The non-axisymmetry exists, for instance, in the vortex ring formed downstream of the mitral valve of healthy hearts, and helps efficient blood momentum transfer from the left atrium toward the aorta. Here, we introduce an index that measures the deviation of a vortex ring from axisymmetry. This index examines the spectrum of the impulse of a naturally-formed vortex ring and expresses the deviation from axisymmetry in terms of the vortex's impulse. We show that the axisymmetry index is related to the second moment of the vorticity distribution of the ring, i.e., as the second moment of vorticity on one side increases compared to the other side, the axisymmetry index decreases accordingly.},

  abstract = {Measurement of the three-dimensional flow field inside the cardiac chambers has proven to be a challenging task. This is mainly due to the fact that generalized full-volume velocimetry techniques cannot be easily implemented to the heart chambers. In addition, the rapid pace of the events in the heart does not allow for accurate real-time flow measurements in 3D using imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging, which neglects the transient variations of the flow due to averaging of the flow over multiple heartbeats. In order to overcome these current limitations, we introduce a multi-planar velocity reconstruction approach that can characterize 3D incompressible flows based on the reconstruction of 2D velocity fields. Here, two-dimensional, two-component velocity fields acquired on multiple perpendicular planes are reconstructed into a 3D velocity field through Kriging interpolation and by imposing the incompressibility constraint. Subsequently, the scattered experimental data are projected into a divergence-free vector field space using a fractional step approach. We validate the method in exemplary 3D flows, including the Hill's spherical vortex and a numerically simulated flow downstream of a 3D orifice. During the process of validation, different signal-to-noise ratios are introduced to the flow field, and the method's performance is assessed accordingly. The results show that as the signal-to-noise ratio decreases, the corrected velocity field significantly improves. The method is also applied to the experimental flow inside a mock model of the heart's right ventricle. Taking advantage of the periodicity of the flow, multiple 2D velocity fields in multiple perpendicular planes at different locations of the mock model are measured while being phaselocked for the 3D reconstruction. The results suggest the metamorphosis of the original transvalvular vortex, which forms downstream of the inlet valve during the early filling phase of the right ventricular model, into a streamline single-leg vortex extending toward the outlet.},

Here, we present a combination of in situ neutron diffraction studies, pVT work, and ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on CO2 clathrates covering a much broader p-T field, stretching from 200 to 270 K and pressures between the hydrate stability limit and 0.6 kPa (6 mbar), a pressure far outside stability. The self-preservation regime above 240 K is confirmed over a broad pressure range and appears to be caused by the annealing of an ice cover formed in the initial hydrate decomposition. Another, previously unknown regime of the self-preservation exists below this temperature, extending however only over a rather narrow pressure range. In this case, the initial ice microstructure is dominated by a fast two-dimensional growth covering rapidly the clathrate surface. All observations lend strong support to the idea that the phenomenon of self-preservation is linked to the permeability of the ice cover governed by (1) the initial microstructure of ice and/or (2) the subsequent annealing of this ice coating. The interplay of the microstructure of newly formed ice and its annealing with the ongoing decomposition reaction leads to various decomposition paths and under certain conditions to a very pronounced preservation anomaly.},

  abstract = {Models to describe the transport of particles in suspension flows have progressed considerably during the last decade. In one class of models, designated as suspension balance models, the stress in the particle phase is described by a constitutive equation, and particle transport is driven by gradients in this stress. In another class of models, designated as diffusive flux models, the motion of particles within the suspension is described through a diffusion equation based on shear rate and effective viscosity gradients. Original implementations of both classes of models lacked a complete description of the anisotropy of the particle interactions. Because of this, the prediction of particle concentration in torsional flows in parallel plate and cone-and-plate geometries did not match experimental data for either class of models. In this work, the normal stress differences for the suspension balance formulation are modeled using a frame-invariant flow-aligned tensor. By analogy, the diffusive flux model is reformulated using the same flow-aligned tensor, which allows separate scaling arguments for the magnitude of the diffusive flux to be implemented in the three principal directions of flow. Using these flow-aligned tensor formulations, the main shortcomings of the original models are eliminated in a unified manner. Steady-state and transient simulations are performed on various one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows for which experimental data are available, using finite-difference and finite-element schemes, respectively. The results obtained are in good agreement with experimental data for consistent sets of empirical constants, without the need for ad hoc additional terms.},

  abstract = {The decrease in apparent relative viscosity that occurs when blood is made to flow through a tube whose diameter is less than about 0.3 mm is a well-known and documented phenomenon in physiology, known as the F\aa hr\ae us-Lindqvist effect. However, since the historical work of F\aa hr\ae us and Lindqvist (Amer. J. Physiol. 96(3): pp. 562\textendash 568, 1931), the underlying physical mechanism has remained enigmatic. A widely accepted qualitative explanation was provided by Haynes (Amer. J. Physiol. 198, pp. 1193\textendash 1200, 1960) according to which blood flows in microvessels with a core-annulus structure, where the erythrocytes concentrate within a central core surrounded by a plasma layer. Although sustained by observations, this conjecture lacks a rigorous deduction from the basic principles of continuum dynamics. Moreover, relations aimed to reproduce the blood apparent relative viscosity, extensively used in micro-circulation, are all empirical and not derived from the analysis of the fluid mechanical phenomena involved. In this paper, we apply the recent results illustrated in Guadagni and Farina (Int. J. Nonlinear Mech. 126, p. 103587, 2020), with the purpose of showing that Haynes' conjecture, slightly corrected to make it more realistic, can be proved and can be used to reach a sound explanation of the F\aa hr\ae us-Lindqvist effect based on continuum mechanics. We propose a theoretical model for the blood apparent relative viscosity which is validated by matching not only the original experimental data reported by F\aa hr\ae us and Lindqvist (Amer. J. Physiol. 96(3), pp. 562\textendash 568, 1931), but also those provided by several subsequent authors.},

The outcomes analyzed were either heart transplantation, if the LVAD was intended as a bridge to transplantation, or hospital discharge if the intention was destination therapy.Results There was no significant difference between groups in pre-LVAD disease severity indicators. Nonpulsatile LVAD recipients had a significantly smaller body surface area (1.9 +/- 0.2 m2 versus 2.1 +/- 0.2 m2, p = 0.04) and cardiopulmonary bypass time was also significantly shorter (61 +/- 34 minutes versus 110 +/- 49 minutes, p = 0.01). Aside from duration of initial intensive care unit stay (nonpulsatile, 10 +/- 16 days; pulsatile, 14 +/- 11 days; p = 0.02), there was no difference in post-LVAD outcomes: 10 of 14 nonpulsatile and 8 of 13 pulsatile LVAD patients achieved the combined end point (p = 0.69).Conclusions Similarly ill congestive heart failure patients benefited equally well from either a nonpulsatile or a pulsatile LVAD. This may support an expanded role for nonpulsatile LVADs in the treatment of severe heart failure.}

The wall fluxes of these platelet-activating agents were estimated for each model thrombus at three different wall shear rates (100 s-1, 800 s-1, and 1,500 s-1), employing experimental data on thrombus growth rates and sizes. For that purpose, whole human blood was perfused in a parallel-plate flow chamber coated with type l fibrillar human collagen, and the kinetic data collected and analyzed by an EPl-fluorescence video microscopy system and a digital image processor. It was found that thrombin concentrations were large enough to cause irreversible platelet aggregation. Although heparin significantly accelerated thrombin inhibition by antithrombin lll, the remaining thrombin levels were still significantly above the minimum threshold required for irreversible platelet aggregation. While ADP concentrations were large enough to cause irreversible platelet aggregation at low shear rates and for small aggregate sizes, TxA2 concentrations were only sufficient to induce platelet shape change over the entire range of wall shear rates and thrombi dimensions studied. Our results also indicated that the local concentration of vWF multimers released from the platelet alpha-granules could be sufficient to modulate platelet aggregation at low and intermediate wall shear rates (less than 1,000 s-1). The sizes of standing vortices formed adjacent to a growing aggregate and the embolizing stresses and the torque, acting at the aggregate surface, were also estimated in this simulation. It was found that standing vortices developed on both sides of the thrombus even at low wall shear rates. Their sizes increased with thrombus size and wall shear rate, and were largely dependent upon thrombus geometry. The experimental observation that platelet aggregation occurred predominantly in the spaces between adjacent thrombi, confirmed the numerical prediction that those standing vortices are regions of reduced fluid velocities and high concentrations of platelet-activating substances, capable of trapping and stimulating platelets for aggregation. The average shear stress and normal stress, as well as the torque, acting to detach the thrombus, increased with increasing wall shear rate. Both stresses were found to be nearly independent of thrombus size and only weekly dependent upon thrombus geometry. Although both stresses had similar values at low wall shear rates, the average shear stress became the predominant embolizing stress at high wall shear rates.},

The mesh quality is maintained through a combination of smoothing and local remeshing in 3D.

  abstract = {Drilling in gas hydrate bearing sediments (HBS) presents an unquantified hazard to safe and cost effective drilling in deep water. A model is developed to simulate the stability of a wellbore drilled in a methane-hydrate bearing sedimentary formation. The model couples the thermodynamic stability of the hydrates in porous media to fluid and thermal transport and to mechanical deformation. The formation mechanical behaviour is modelled as poro-elasto-plastic, and the failure condition is represented by a Mohr Coulomb yield criterion. As hydrates in the pore space dissociate, the reduction in grain cementation is represented in the model by progressive loss of cohesion. The fluid flow and resulting pore pressure distribution is modelled using a single-phase Darcy flow model. The effect of the varying pore pressure on the stress field is accounted for in the stability analysis. The pore fluid composition is assumed to be water containing 3.5\% NaCl, with methane as the hydrate-forming gas. A lookup table based on thermodynamic calculations is used to simulate the change in hydrate stability as a result of variation in the system pressure and temperature associated with drilling a wellbore using a drilling fluid several degrees hotter than ambient. If at a certain temperature, the system pressure is below that in the phase diagram, hydrates will draw in heat and dissociate. Boyle's Law for an ideal gas is used to equilibrate pressures after the dissociation step. The remaining amount of hydrates in the pore space is calculated accordingly, and the change in porosity is updated. The modified cohesion corresponding to the remaining percentage of hydrates is then fed back into the model. The developed numerical model is found to be very useful in understanding the behaviour and predict the responses of HBS to processes associated with overbalance drilling of a wellbore.

A novel technique is presented to assess the relation between fluid dynamic variables and the permeability of the endothelium to macromolecules. Fully anesthetized, domestic swine were intravenously injected with the albumin marker Evans blue dye, which was allowed to circulate for 90 min. After the animals were euthanized, silicone casts were made of the abdominal aorta and its iliac branches. Pulsatile flow calculations were subsequently made in computational regions derived from the casts. The distribution of the calculated time-dependent wall shear stress in the external lilac branches was directly compared on a point-by-point basis with the spatially varying in vivo uptake of Evans blue dye in the same arteries. The results indicate that in vivo endothelial permeability to albumin decreases with increasing time-average shear stress over the normal range. Additionally, endothelial permeability increases slightly with oscillatory shear index. computational fluid dynamics; in vivo measurement; oscillatory shear index; albumin; Evans blue dye},

Here we summarize some ofthe pertinent data and discuss some recent studies ofthe initiation and propagation ofplatelet accumulation into thrombi and the initiation and propagation of thrombin generation. Mice lacking platelet surface glycoprotein VI (GPVI) form normal thrombi in the laser injury model but have a diminished thrombotic response to severe FeCl3 injury. We hypothesize that the paths to thrombus formation in these two models are different with interaction ofGPVI and collagen predominant early after severe FeCl3-induced injury but platelet activation by thrombin predominant after laser-induced injury. Understanding of the response to insult in thrombosis models deepens our understanding of the process and provides a firm foundation for evaluation of anti-thrombotic therapy in these models.

OBJECTIVES: To present a three dimensional particle trace visualisation of normal left atrial flow in vivo, constructed from flow velocities in three dimensional space. METHODS: Particle trace visualisation of time resolved three dimensional magnetic resonance imaging velocity measurements was used to provide a display of intracardiac flow without the limitations of angle sensitivity or restriction to imaging planes. Global flow patterns of the left atrium were studied in 11 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: In all subjects vortical flow was observed in the atrium during systole and diastolic diastasis (mean (SD) duration of systolic vortex, 280 (77) ms; and of diastolic vortex, 256 (118) ms). The volume incorporated and recirculated within the vortices originated predominantly from the left pulmonary veins. Inflow from the right veins passed along the vortex periphery, constrained between the vortex and the atrial wall. CONCLUSIONS: Global left atrial flow in the normal human heart comprises consistent patterns specific to the phase of the cardiac cycle. Separate paths of left and right pulmonary venous inflow and vortex formation may have beneficial effects in avoiding left atrial stasis in the normal subject in sinus rhythm.},

  abstract = {The rationale for this study lies in the well-known predilection for vascular disease of the carotid bifurcation, attributed to an altered shear stress distribution at the luminal surface and mitigated by helical fluid structures establishing inside the bifurcation. Here we investigate the mechanistic role played by the common carotid artery (CCA) in promoting complex intravascular flow and in influencing the hemodynamics at the distal carotid bifurcation. Fifty-five image-based computational hemodynamic models of eleven right carotid geometries were reconstructed from its brachiocephalic origin to above the bifurcation to assess how five different CCA reconstruction length affects intravascular fluid structures entering the bifurcation. A quantitative description of helical flow is adopted, in parallel to the description of disturbed shear at the bifurcation luminal surface. Our findings support the hypothesis that helical flow in CCA might reduce the likelihood of flow disturbances at the bifurcation. This confirms the physiological role of CCA in transporting and enforcing helical flow structures into the bifurcation, giving further contribution to the helicity-driven suppression of disturbed shear. A quantitative analysis of CCA geometry highlights the beneficial effect of proximal CCA curvature on helical flow and shows the complex interlacement among CCA geometry, helical flow, and disturbed shear at the bifurcation. Since helicity-based descriptors and geometric descriptors relative to the bifurcation have been shown to be significant predictors of disturbed shear, in principle they may be augmented by factors related to CCA geometry and hemodynamics.},

  abstract = {Chronic heart failure is a medical condition that involves structural and functional changes of the heart and a progressive reduction in cardiac output. Heart failure is classified into two categories: diastolic heart failure, a thickening of the ventricular wall associated with impaired filling; and systolic heart failure, a dilation of the ventricles associated with reduced pump function. In theory, the pathophysiology of heart failure is well understood. In practice, however, heart failure is highly sensitive to cardiac microstructure, geometry, and loading. This makes it virtually impossible to predict the time line of heart failure for a diseased individual. Here we show that computational modeling allows us to integrate knowledge from different scales to create an individualized model for cardiac growth and remodeling during chronic heart failure. Our model naturally connects molecular events of parallel and serial sarcomere deposition with cellular phenomena of myofibrillogenesis and sarcomerogenesis to whole organ function. Our simulations predict chronic alterations in wall thickness, chamber size, and cardiac geometry, which agree favorably with the clinical observations in patients with diastolic and systolic heart failure. In contrast to existing single- or bi-ventricular models, our new four-chamber model can also predict characteristic secondary effects including papillary muscle dislocation, annular dilation, regurgitant flow, and outflow obstruction. Our prototype study suggests that computational modeling provides a patient-specific window into the progression of heart failure with a view towards personalized treatment planning.},

In situ observations of the formation of porous CH4- and CO2-hydrates from deuterated ice Ih powders were made at different pressures and temperatures, using time-resolved neutron diffraction data from the high-flux D20 diffractometer (ILL, Grenoble) as well as in-house gas consumption measurements. The CO2 experiments conducted at low temperatures are particularly important for settling the open question of the existence Of CO2 hydrates on Mars. We found that at similar excess fugacities, the reaction of CO2 was distinctly faster than that of CH4. A phenomenological model for the kinetics of the gas hydrate formation from powders of spherical ice particles is developed with emphasis on ice-grain fracturing and sample-consolidation effects due to the outward growth of gas hydrate. It describes (1) the initial stage of fast crack-filling and hydrate film spreading over the ice surface and the two subsequent stages which are limited by (2) the clathration reaction at the ice-hydrate interface and/or by (3) the diffusive gas and water transport through the hydrate shells surrounding the shrinking ice cores. In the case Of CO2-hydrate, the activation energies of the ice-surface coating in stage I are estimated to be 5.5 kJ/mol at low temperatures and 31.5 kJ/mol above 220 K, indicating that water molecule mobility at the ice surface plays a considerable role in the clathration reaction. Comparable activation energies of 42.3 and 54.6 kJ/mol are observed in the high temperature range for the reaction- and diffusion-limited stages 2 and 3, respectively.},

Since the hydrate formation process consumes large amounts of gas volume, the gas supply must continuously feed the specimen during the formation process, while maintaining a constant gas pressure. Large pressure fluctuations occur as the gas is constantly being consumed for the hydrate formation; thus, high-pressure gas cylinders equipped with regulators are not able to maintain steady conditions. In order to overcome this deficiency, a gas system was developed for application to hydrate formation or other conventional triaxial apparatus that have been designed for high-pressure strength testing of soils. The details of the system and formulations for hydrate content determination are presented.},

  abstract = {In the conventional approach for fluid-structure interaction problems, the fluid and solid components are treated separately and information is exchanged across their interface. According to the conventional terminology, the current numerical methods can be grouped in two major categories: Partitioned methods and monolithic methods. Both methods use two separate sets of equations for fluid and solid. A unified solution method has been presented (1), which is different from these methods. The new method treats both fluid and solid as a single continuum, thus the whole computational domain is treated as one entity discretised on a single grid. Its behavior is described by a single set of equations, which are solved fully implicitly. In this paper, 2 time marching and one spatial discretisation scheme, widely used for fluids' equations, are applied for the solution of the equations for solids. Using linear stability analysis, the accuracy and dissipation characteristics of the resulting difference equations are examined. The aforementioned schemes are applied to a transient structural problem (beam bending) and the results compare favorably with available analytic solutions and are consistent with the conclusions of the stability analysis. A parametric investigation using different meshes, time steps and beam sizes is also presented. For all cases examined the numerical solution was stable and robust and proved to be suitable for the next stage of application to full fluid-structure interaction problems.},

The time-dependent flow rate for the Newtonian and the non-Newtonian blood analog fluid were identical. For the numerical computation, a Carreau-Yasuda model was employed to accommodate the shear thinning behavior of the Xanthan gum solution. The viscoelastic properties were not taken into account. The experimental results indicate that significant differences between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid are present. The numerical results for both the Newtonian and the non-Newtonian fluid agree well with the experimental results. Since viscoelasticity was not included in the numerical code, shear thinning behavior of the blood analog fluid seems to be the dominant non-Newtonian property, even under unsteady flow conditions. Finally, a comparison between the non-Newtonian fluid model and a Newtonian fluid at a rescaled Reynolds number is presented. The rescaled Reynolds number, based on a characteristic rather than the high-shear rate viscosity of the Xanthan gum solution, was about three times as low as the original Reynolds number. Comparison reveals that the character of flow of the non-Newtonian fluid is simulated quite well by using the appropriate Reynolds number.}

  abstract = {We present a new numerical methodology for simulating fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) problems involving thin flexible bodies in an incompressible fluid. The FSI algorithm uses the Dirichlet\textendash Neumann partitioning technique. The curvilinear immersed boundary method (CURVIB) is coupled with a rotation-free finite element (FE) model for thin shells enabling the efficient simulation of FSI problems with arbitrarily large deformation. Turbulent flow problems are handled using large-eddy simulation with the dynamic Smagorinsky model in conjunction with a wall model to reconstruct boundary conditions near immersed boundaries. The CURVIB and FE solvers are coupled together on the flexible solid\textendash fluid interfaces where the structural nodal positions, displacements, velocities and loads are calculated and exchanged between the two solvers. Loose and strong coupling FSI schemes are employed enhanced by the Aitken acceleration technique to ensure robust coupling and fast convergence especially for low mass ratio problems. The coupled CURVIB-FE-FSI method is validated by applying it to simulate two FSI problems involving thin flexible structures: 1) vortex-induced vibrations of a cantilever mounted in the wake of a square cylinder at different mass ratios and at low Reynolds number; and 2) the more challenging high Reynolds number problem involving the oscillation of an inverted elastic flag. For both cases the computed results are in excellent agreement with previous numerical simulations and/or experiential measurements. Grid convergence tests/studies are carried out for both the cantilever and inverted flag problems, which show that the CURVIB-FE-FSI method provides their convergence. Finally, the capability of the new methodology in simulations of complex cardiovascular flows is demonstrated by applying it to simulate the FSI of a tri-leaflet, prosthetic heart valve in an anatomic aorta and under physiologic pulsatile conditions.}

  abstract = {Echocardiographic particle imaging velocimetry allows blood flow visualization and characterization of diastolic vortex formation that may play a key role in filling efficiency. We hypothesized that abrupt withdrawal of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) would alter the timing of left ventricular diastolic vortex formation and modify cardiac time intervals. In patients with heart failure (HF) who had chronically implanted CRT devices, the timing of the onset of the diastolic vortex (TDV) from mitral valve opening, transmitral flow, and cardiac time intervals was measured at baseline and after deactivation and reactivation of CRT. Compared with control patients with cardiovascular risk factors but structurally normal hearts, TDV was significantly delayed in patients with HF. Deactivation of CRT resulted in striking delay in TDV due to disorganized flow and reduced flow acceleration, and reactivation reversed these characteristics instantly. In addition, CRT deactivation also prolonged the isovolumic contraction interval, which closely correlated with the changes in the TDV. These data suggest that CRT plays an important role in optimization of left ventricular diastolic filling.},

In most respects the results ofRamsey \& Street (1940) were confirmed, but (a) the peak of the curve was found to consist of a plateau between sarcomere lengths of 2-05 and 2-2 j\&, (b) the decline of tension above this plateau is steeper than found by Ramsey \& Street, and (c) the decline of tension below the plateau becomes suddenly steeper at a sarcomere length of about 1*67, . 3. Many features of this length-tension relation are simply explained on the sliding-filament theory. 4. It is concluded that, in the plateau and at greater lengths, the tension on each thin filament is made up of equal contributions from each bridge which it overlaps on adjacent thick filaments. 5. Internal resistance to shortening is negligible in this range but becomes progresively more important with shortening below the plateau.}

New seismic data from the Blake Ridge, a hydrate-bearing drift deposit in the western Atlantic, show clear evidence for methane release and suggest a new mechanism by which methane gas can escape, without thermal or mechanical disruption of the hydrate-bearing layer. Rapid, post\textendash 2.5 Ma formation of large sediment waves and associated seafloor erosion created permeable pathways connecting free gas to the seafloor, allowing methane gas expulsion. The amount of missing methane, 0.6 Gt, is equivalent to {$\sim$}12\% of total present-day atmospheric methane. Our results imply that significant amounts of methane gas can bypass the hydrate stability zone and escape into the ocean. Mechanisms of tapping methane directly from the free-gas zone, such as widespread seafloor erosion, should be considered when seeking the causes of large negative carbon isotope excursions in the geological record.},

  abstract = {he mechanism of arterial thrombosis, including coronary thrombosis, is different from that of thrombosis which occurs at sites of blood stasis such as deep venous thrombosis. Considering the onset of arterial thrombus formation, soluble coagulant factors may not play important roles for its onset since they are diluted by the effect of blood flow and cannot reach high enough concentrations to form insoluble fibrin. Platelets, which can stick to damaged vascular lumen even in the presence of shearing effects of blood flow, may play a crucial role in the onset of arterial thrombus formation. Thus, the mechanism of platelet thrombus formation should be assessed in the presence of blood flow. However, current dogma that fibrinogen binding to activated GP IIb/IIIa is the final common pathway for platelet thrombus formation was developed by using the function assay system of aggregometer, in which the effects of blood flow were not seriously considered. We are proposing in this review that plasma ligand protein of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and its interactions with platelet GP lb and GP IIb/IIa, which become apparent only in assays systems under influence of high shear rates of flow condition such as flowchambers or coneplate viscometers, are the key events leading to the onset of arterial thrombosis. A better understanding of the vWF-mediated mechanism of platelet thrombus formation is important for the development of better clinical tools to prevent ischemic heart disease as well as for a complete understanding of the mechanism of coronary thrombosis.}

  abstract = {Platelet aggregation induced by stirring of a platelet suspension after activation by the exogenous addition of stimulants, such as ADP, epinephrine and thrombin, has long been used as a platelet function test, and for the screening of antiplatelet agents. Since platelet aggregation has been demonstrated to be mediated exclusively by the binding of plasma fibrinogen to the activated GP IIb / IIIa, anti-GP IIb / IIIa agents, which can completely inhibit platelet aggregation, were expected to become among the most potent of antithrombotic agents. The strong preventive effects of anti-GP IIb / IIIa agents against thrombotic complications after coronary intervention, and the weaker preventive effects of the same agents against the onset of coronary thrombosis in unstable angina pectoris patients point to both the efficacy and the limitations of anti-GP IIb / IIIa antithrombotic agents. Recently, many investigators have reported that platelets play a major role in thrombus formation at sites exposed to blood flow. Several platelet-function assay systems have been developed to elucidate the mechanism of thrombus formation under blood flow conditions. Numerous studies have demonstrated that von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its interaction with its receptors on platelets, including GP Ibagr and GP IIb / IIIa, play essential roles not only in platelet activation, but also in platelet adhesion and possibly platelet cohesion. These findings prompted us to explore whether the VWF-mediated process of thrombus formation could be exploited as a target for potential antiplatelet agents. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that multiple synergistic signals, including those mediated by catecholamine receptors, purine nucleotide receptors, as well as some types of collagen receptors are involved in the process of VWF-mediated platelet thrombus formation. We now have new antiplatelet agents on the horizon, targeted against thrombus formation under blood flow conditions.}

  abstract = {Pressure drop associated with coarctation of the aorta (CoA) can be successfully treated surgically or by stent placement. However, a decreased life expectancy associated with altered aortic hemodynamics was found in long-term studies. Image-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is intended to support particular diagnoses, to help in choosing between treatment options, and to improve performance of treatment procedures. This study aimed to prove the ability of CFD to improve aortic hemodynamics in CoA patients. In 13 patients (6 males, 7 females; mean age 25 {$\pm$} 14 years), we compared pre- and post-treatment peak systole hemodynamics [pressure drops and wall shear stress (WSS)] vs. virtual treatment as proposed by biomedical engineers. Anatomy and flow data for CFD were based on MRI and angiography. Segmentation, geometry reconstruction and virtual treatment geometry were performed using the software ZIBAmira, whereas peak systole flow conditions were simulated with the software ANSYS(\textregistered ) Fluent(\textregistered ). Virtual treatment significantly reduced pressure drop compared to post-treatment values by a mean of 2.8 {$\pm$} 3.15 mmHg, which significantly reduced mean WSS by 3.8 Pa. Thus, CFD has the potential to improve post-treatment hemodynamics associated with poor long-term prognosis of patients with coarctation of the aorta. MRI-based CFD has a huge potential to allow the slight reduction of post-treatment pressure drop, which causes significant improvement (reduction) of the WSS at the stenosis segment.},

Special attention is devoted to the relationship between the evolution of the driving forces and various mechanisms that contribute to the shear-induced migration of the suspended particles. This analysis reveals that suspension rheometry can complement other techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, in qualitatively and quantitatively evaluating the model parameters.},

A review of current methods of fluid\textendash structure coupling highlights common limitations of high computational cost and solution instability. It is proposed that these limitations can be overcome by an alternative approach in which both fluid and solid components are solved within a single discretized continuum domain. A single system of momentum and continuity equations is therefore derived that governs both fluids and solids and which are solved with a single mesh using finite volume discretization schemes. The method is validated first by simulating dynamic oscillation of a clamped elastic beam. It is then applied to study the case of interest\textemdash wave propagation in highly flexible tubes\textemdash in which a predicted wave speed of 8.58 m/s falls within 2\% of an approximate analytical solution. The method shows further good agreement with analytical solutions for tubes of increasing rigidity, covering a range of wave speeds from those found in arteries to that in the undisturbed fluid.

They have rarely been derived for hemodynamic parameters known to affect the cardiovascular system, e.g., wall shear stress (WSS). This work describes noninvasive methods to quantify and determine a scaling law for WSS. Geometry and blood flow velocities in the infrarenal aorta of mice and rats under isoflurane anesthesia were quantified using two-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging at 4.7 tesla. Three-dimensional models constructed from anatomic data were discretized and used for computational fluid dynamic simulations using phase-contrast velocity imaging data as inlet boundary conditions. WSS was calculated along the infrarenal aorta and compared between species to formulate an allometric equation for WSS. Mean WSS along the infrarenal aorta was significantly greater in mice and rats compared with humans (87.6, 70.5, and 4.8 dyn/cm(2), P {$<$} 0.01), and a scaling exponent of -0.38 (R(2) = 0.92) was determined. Manipulation of the murine genome has made small animal models standard surrogates for better understanding the healthy and diseased human cardiovascular system. It has therefore become increasingly important to understand how results scale from mouse to human. This noninvasive methodology provides the opportunity to serially quantify changes in WSS during disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {It is a typical multiphase flow process for hydrate formation in seeping seafloor sediments. Free gas can not only be present but also take part in formation of hydrate. The volume fraction of free gas in local pore of hydrate stable zone (HSZ) influences the formation of hydrate in seeping seafloor area, and methane flux determines the abundance and resource of hydrate-bearing reservoirs. In this paper, a multiphase flow model including water (dissolved methane and salt)-free gas hydrate has been established to describe this kind of flow-transfer-reaction process where there exists a large scale of free gas migration and transform in seafloor pore. In the order of three different scenarios, the conversions among permeability, capillary pressure, phase saturations and salinity along with the formation of hydrate have been deducted. Furthermore, the influence of four sorts of free gas saturations and three classes of methane fluxes on hydrate formation and the resource has also been analyzed and compared. Based on the rules drawn from the simulation, and combined information gotten from drills in field, the methane hydrate(MH) formation in Shenhu area of South China Sea has been forecasted. It has been speculated that there may breed a moderate methane flux below this seafloor HSZ. If the flux is about 0.5 kg m(-2) a(-1), then it will go on to evolve about 2700 ka until the hydrate saturation in pore will arrive its peak (about 75\%). Approximately 1.47 x 10(9) m(3) MH has been reckoned in this marine basin finally, is about 13 times over preliminary estimate. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The leaflet and the flow behaviours around the bileaflet valve were investigated numerically and experimentally by performing particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, it was shown that the leaflet behaviour and the velocity fields were similar in both models. The present study allows the validation of a fully coupled 3-D FSI numerical model. The promising numerical tool could be therefore used to investigate clinical issues involving the aortic valve.},

  abstract = {Methane hydrate was formed in water occupying the interstitial spaces of a cylindrical bed of silica sand particles. The sand particles have an average diameter equal to 329 ?m. The amount of methane consumed during the experiment (methane gas uptake) was determined through pressure and temperature measurements and mass balance calculations. Three different sized beds of silica sand particles were used. Water conversion to hydrates in the range of 73-84\% was achieved for all of the formation experiments. Hydrate formation was followed by decomposition at 4.0 C driven by depressurization at 3.1 MPa (nine experiments) and 2.3 MPa (one experiment). Methane recovery measurement curves were determined for each experiment. The initial rate of recovery was found to be strongly dependent on the silica sand bed size. The rate of recovery was found to depend weakly on the size during the second stage, and after 1.25 h, it was constant. During decomposition at 2.3 MPa, the temperature in some locations inside the bed dropped below the freezing point of water and the gas recovery rate was enhanced. This is in agreement with recently reported conclusions by Tsypkin [Fluid Dynamics 2005, 40 (1), 117-125] and Zhou et al. [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2009, 48 (6), 3142-3149]. Finally, the gas recovery data was correlated with an empirical model with one parameter that was found to depend linearly on the bed size.},

This model's micro-current flow field and associated density adjustment, when considered in the linear, low-Reynolds number regime, may be decomposed into independent, superposable contributions arising from various error terms in its immersed boundary force. Error force contributions which are rotational (solenoidal) are mainly responsible for the micro-current (corresponding density adjustment). Rotationally anisotropic error terms arise from numerical derivatives and from the sampling of the interface-supporting force. They may be removed, either by eliminating the causal error force or by negating it. It is found to be straightforward to design more effective stencils with significantly improved performance. Practically, the micro-current activity arising in Lishchuk's method is reduced by approximately three quarters by using an appropriate stencil and approximately by an order of magnitude when the effects of sampling are removed.},

Hence, significant parts of the model are required to be simulated with little overall effect on the accuracy of data fitting, as well as dramatically increasing the complexity of parameter identification. This separates sub-structures of more complex cardiovascular system models to create uniquely identifiable simplified models that are one to one with the measurements. In addition, a new concept of parameter identification is presented where the changes in the parameters are treated as an actuation force into a feed back control system, and the reference output is taken to be steady state values of measured volume and pressure. The major advantage of the method is that when it converges, it must be at the global minimum so that the solution that best fits the data is always found. By utilizing continuous information from the arterial/pulmonary pressure waveforms and the end-diastolic time, it is shown that potentially, the ventricle volume is not required in the data set, which was a requirement in earlier published work. The simplified models can also act as a bridge to identifying more sophisticated cardiac models, by providing an initial set of patient specific parameters that can reveal trends and interactions in the data over time. The goal is to apply the simplified models to retrospective data on groups of patients to help characterize population trends or un-modelled dynamics within known bounds. These trends can assist in improved prediction of patient responses to cardiac disturbance and therapy intervention with potentially smaller and less invasive data sets. In this way a more complex model that takes into account individual patient variation can be developed, and applied to the improvement of cardiovascular management in critical care.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to investigate different outlet boundary conditions for a straight compliant tube, by the means of fluid-structure interaction simulations. In addition to investigating boundary conditions it was desirable to see how different parameters, like time step, grid refinement and CFL-number would influence the results. Simulations were run with different time steps and grids. Changing these parameters had only minor influence on the results of the simulations, except for very small time steps, when the simulations would not converge. Four different boundary conditions were tested at the outlet: A reflection free boundary, an imposed reflection factor of 0.9, a two-element Windkessel model and a three-element Windkessel model. The reflection free model gave almost no reflections, while the simulation with a reflection factor of 0.9 gave the imposed amount of reflections at the outlet. For the reflection free case, comparing the results with simpler, analytical solutions gave poor accuracy, because the assumption of Poiseuille flow was invalid. Changing the velocity profile at the inlet from uniform to parabolic improved the accuracy. The two-element Windkessel model was not able to model a reflection free outlet. Reflections would occur even when the parameters were chosen to give a theoretically reflection free outlet. This was improved by using the three-element Windkessel model. When choosing parameters that would theoretically give zero reflections, the amount of reflections was very low.},

The effects of dynamic cardiac compression (DCC) have been less well modeled. This paper considers the interaction between a DCC device and a closed-loop numerical model of the cardiovascular system, which is specifically developed. The model is operated in real-time, and interfaced to the physical assist device for realistic testing. Assist control strategies are compared: constant pressure DCC, and volume-proportional pressure to simulate cardiomyoplasty. The model shows that applying equal pressure to both ventricles causes inflation of the left ventricle.}

The applied open source tools are the commonly used OpenFOAM, based on the finite volume method (FVM), and OpenLB, an implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The near-wall region is modeled by the Musker equation coupled to a van Driest damped Smagorinsky-Lilly sub-grid scale model to decrease the required mesh resolution. The results of both frameworks are compared to a stationary engine flow bench experiment by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV). The validation covers a detailed error analysis using time-averaged and root mean square (RMS) velocity fields. Grid studies are performed to examine the performance of the two solvers. In addition, the differences in the processes of grid generation are highlighted. The performance results show that the OpenLB approach is on average 32 times faster than the OpenFOAM implementation for the tested configurations. This indicates the potential of LBM for the simulation of IC engine-relevant complex turbulent flows using NWM-LES with computationally economic costs.},

The stimulation was carried out in the unconsolidated sediment from the South China Sea by applying 2.45 GHz microwave with the average radiation densities ranging from 3 to 19 kW/m2.We observe that the far-field hydrate layer, which exceeds the microwave penetration depth, dissociated at equilibrium. The hydrate saturation (15.5-54.5\%), water saturation (40.7 and 70.4\%), freezing and combining with depressurization affect the heating and gas production behaviors, as well as the production efficiency. The formation of ice reduces the gas production efficiency for the frozen sediment but boosts the gas production for the unfrozen sediment combining with depressurization.},

High-flying nocturnally migrating common swifts, Apus apus, have been shown to compensate for wind drift, but they failed to adjust airspeed as expected (increase in head wind and decrease in tail wind in relation to neutral wind). We report on new measurements of diurnally migrating common swifts at a coastal site in the Baltic, where the birds did adjust airspeed adaptively during spring and autumn migration. During autumn migration, they compensated for lateral wind drift by adjusting heading direction similarly to high-altitude migrants in autumn. We also recorded flight speed and wind compensation during a summer weather-related exodus, when the birds behaved similarly to those during autumn migration, although they showed a small degree of wind drift. Why birds failed to adjust airspeed adaptively at high altitude is discussed, and we argue there is a threshold in the sensory system to detect small changes in optic flow based on visual landmarks.}

  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;A review is presented on biorheological studies of platelet activation and platelet-platelet binding events that play key roles in thrombosis and hemostasis. Rheological methods have been used by a number of workers to establish the importance of fluid mechanical shear stress as a determinate of platelet reactions. Fluid mechanical shear stress can be regarded as a platelet agonist that is always present in the circulation and that is synergistic in its actions with other agonists. Early biorheological studies were phenomenological in that they focused on stress effects on measures of platelet function. Subsequent studies have elucidated mechanisms and have shown that the biochemical pathways of platelet activation are very different at elevated shear stresses than in the low shear stress environment used in many platelet activation studies. This finding that biochemical pathways of platelet activations are different at different shear stress levels suggests that it may be possible to develop platelet inhibitors of highly specific action: it may be possible to inhibit pathways important in thrombosis in a partially occluded artery without seriously compromising the normal hemostatic function of platelets. Another aspect of the work suggests that the biorheological approach may make it possible to develop better methods for prediction of thrombotic tendencies in human subjects.}

  abstract = {Hemodynamic shear stress, the frictional force acting on vascular endothelial cells, is crucial for endothelial homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. When discussing blood flow effects on various forms of endothelial (dys)function, one considers two flow patterns: steady laminar flow and disturbed flow because endothelial cells respond differently to these flow types both in vivo and in vitro. Laminar flow which exerts steady laminar shear stress is atheroprotective while disturbed flow creates an atheroprone environment. Emerging evidence has provided new insights into the cellular mechanisms of flow-dependent regulation of vascular function that leads to cardiovascular events such as atherosclerosis, atherothrombosis, and myocardial infarction. In order to study effects of shear stress and different types of flow, various models have been used. In this review, we will summarize our current views on how disturbed flow-mediated signaling pathways are involved in the development of atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems are pervasive in the computational engineering community. The need to address challenging FSI problems has led to the development of a broad range of numerical meth- ods addressing a variety of application-specific demands. While a range of numerical and experimental benchmarks are present in the literature, few solutions are available that enable both verification and spa- tiotemporal convergence analysis. In this paper, we introduce a class of analytic solutions to FSI problems involving shear in channels and pipes. Comprised of 16 separate analytic solutions, our approach is per- muted to enable progressive verification and analysis of FSI methods and implementations, in two and three dimensions, for static and transient scenarios as well as for linear and hyperelastic solid materials. Results are shown for a range of analytic models exhibiting progressively complex behavior. The utility of these solutions for analysis of convergence behavior is further demonstrated using a previously published mono- lithic FSI technique. The resulting class of analytic solutions addresses a core challenge in the development of novel FSI algorithms and implementations, providing a progressive testbed for verification and detailed convergence analysis.},

Focus of the experiment is on biomedical engineering applications with flow being in the laminar regime with Reynolds numbers 1283 and 651. Flow and solid domains were defined using computer-aided design (CAD) tools. The experimental design aimed at providing a straightforward boundary condition definition. Material parameters and mechanical response of a moderately viscous Newtonian fluid and a nonlinear incompressible solid were experimentally determined. A comprehensive data set was acquired by using magnetic resonance imaging to record the interaction between the fluid and the solid, quantifying flow and solid motion.},

  abstract = {This book gives an introduction to the basics of aerothermodynamics, as applied in particular to winged re-entry vehicles and airbreathing cruise and acceleration vehicles. Beginning with a broad vehicle classification and a discussion of the flight environment, Basics of Aero-thermodynamics focuses on flight in the earth's atmosphere at speeds below approximately 8.0 km/s at altitudes below approximately 100.0 km. At such flight conditions the outer surfaces of hypersonic flight vehicles primarily are radiation cooled. This is taken into account by an introduction to the problem of the thermal state of the surface, and especially to the phenomena connected with surface radiation cooling. These are themes, which reappear throughout the remaining chapters. The implications of radiation cooling are different for the different vehicle classes. In any case the properties of both attached viscous and separating flows as well as thermo-chemical effects at and near the vehicle surface need to be considered. After a review of the issues of transport of momentum, energy and mass, real-gas effects as well as inviscid and viscous flow phenomena are treated. In view of their special importance for airbreathing hypersonic flight vehicles and for the discrete numerical methods of aerothermodynamics, considerable discussion is devoted to the issues of laminar\textendash turbulent transition and turbulence, which follows a treatment of strong-interaction phenomena. Finally, simulation techniques for aerothermodynamics are considered, including computational methods and their modelling problems, as well as the problems of ground facility and in-flight simulation, including the hot experimental technique. The implications of Oswatitsch's Mach number independence principle are also treated.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {The aim of this position paper is to provide a brief overview of the current status of cardiovascular modelling and of the processes required and some of the challenges to be addressed to see wider exploitation in both personal health management and clinical practice. In most branches of engineering the concept of the digital twin, informed by extensive and continuous monitoring and coupled with robust data assimilation and simulation techniques, is gaining traction: the Gartner Group listed it as one of the top ten digital trends in 2018. The cardiovascular modelling community is starting to develop a much more systematic approach to the combination of physics, mathematics, control theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science and advanced engineering methodology, as well as working more closely with the clinical community to better understand and exploit physiological measurements, and indeed to develop jointly better measurement protocols informed by model-based understanding. Developments in physiological modelling, model personalisation, model outcome uncertainty, and the role of models in clinical decision support are addressed and `where-next' steps and challenges discussed.},

Despite the potential impact, it is not straightforward to use these models for individualized diagnosis and intervention planning (model predictive decision support). Major challenges are the adaptation of the models to patient-specific conditions and the necessary uncertainty assessment of the simulated outcome measures. In this manuscript, we will present our view on what is needed to make cardiovascular models suitable for clinical decision support. Hereto, we will first describe how an engineer might support clinical decisions. Secondly, we will give a description of the challenges faced by the engineers. Finally we will introduce an innovative approach in which model personalization is guided by sensitivity analysis, and in which the effect of input uncertainties and model assumptions (acknowledged model errors) on model predictions are considered during model corroboration. The approach is illustrated by two different vascular cases. Hopefully our view will be useful in bringing models from the pre-clinical phase to the clinical phase where they will actually be used for model predictive decision support.},

  abstract = {Blood viscosity is a crucial element for any computation of flow fields in the vasculature or blood-wetted devices. Although blood is comprised of multiple elements, and its viscosity can vary widely depending on several factors, in practical applications, it is commonly assumed to be a homogeneous, Newtonian fluid with a nominal viscosity typically of 3.5 cP. Two quasi-mechanistic models for viscosity are presented here, built on the foundation of the Krieger model of suspensions, in which dependencies on shear rate, hematocrit, and plasma protein concentrations are explicitly represented. A 3-parameter Asymptotic Krieger model (AKM) exhibited excellent agreement with published Couette experiments over four decades of shear rate (0\textendash 1000 s-1, root mean square (RMS) error = 0.21 cP). A 5-parameter Modified Krieger Model (MKM5) also demonstrated a very good fit to the data (RMS error = 1.74 cP). These models avoid discontinuities exhibited by previous models with respect to hematocrit and shear rate. In summary, the quasi-mechanistic, Modified-Krieger Model presented here offers a reasonable compromise in complexity to provide flexibility to account for several factors that affect viscosity in practical applications, while assuring accuracy and stability.},

The objective of the present study is to investigate the detailed distribution of hemodynamic parameters (wall shear stress (WSS), spatial gradient of wall shear stress (WSSG), and oscillatory shear index (OSI)) in the entire length of C57BL/6 mouse aorta with all primary branches (from ascending aorta to common iliac bifurcation). The detailed geometrical parameters (e.g., diameter and length of the vessels) were obtained from casts of entire aorta and primary branches of mice. The flow velocity was measured at the inlet of ascending aorta using Doppler flowprobe in mice. The outlet pressure boundary condition was estimated based on scaling law. The continuity and Navier-Stokes equations were solved using three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). The model prediction was tested by comparing the computed flow rate with the flow rate measured just before the common iliac bifurcation, and good agreement was found. It was also found that complex flow patterns occur at bifurcations between main trunk and branches. The major branches of terminal aorta, with the highest proportion of atherosclerosis, have the lowest WSS, and the relatively atherosclerotic-prone aortic arch has much more complex WSS distribution and higher OSI value than other sites. The low WSS coincides with the high OSI, which approximately obeys a power law relationship. Furthermore, the scaling law between flow and diameter holds in the entire aorta and primary branches of mice under pulsatile blood flow conditions. This model will eventually serve to elucidate the causal relation between hemodynamic patterns and atherogenesis in KO mice.},

  abstract = {A variety of studies reported in the literature have established that initially well mixed suspensions subjected to non-homogeneous shear flows attain an anisotropic particulate structure. It has also been shown that non-homogeneous shearing causes suspensions of unimodal spheres to demix, i.e., gradients in solids concentration are formed. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of non-homogeneous shear flows on suspensions of bimodal particles, and specifically, to determine if the solids concentration gradients which develop are accompanied by size segregation of the coarse with respect to the fine fraction. We used the simplest and most direct methods to determine the relative solids concentrations: visual observation of tracer particles in transparent suspensions and physical separation of the coarse and fine solid fractions. Three different types of non-homogeneous shear flows were examined, and in each case the data support two main conclusions: 1) suspended particles migrate from regions of high shear rate to regions of low shear rate, and 2) the coarse fraction of particles migrates much faster than the fine fraction, leading to size segregation of initially well-mixed suspensions. While the former conclusion is consistent with other studies reported in the literature, to our knowledge this paper provides the first data supporting and, to a limited extent, quantifying the latter conclusion.}

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common complication of cardiac ischemia, however, the impact of MI on the left ventricle (LV) flow patterns has not been widely considered by computational fluid dynamics studies thus far. In this study, we present an insightful numerical method that creates an artificial MI on an image-based fluid-structure interactional model of normal LV to investigate its influence on the flow in comparison with the normal case. Seventeen different models were developed to evaluate the effects of location, percentage, myocardial material properties and dilation size of MI on the LV's performance, area strain, wall displacement, pressure-volume loop, wall shear stress and velocity field. The results show that MI considerably changes blood flow features which are fully dependent on MI parameters. For the case of constant MI location, the effect of a decrease of infarcted myocardium stiffness, increase of dilation size and increase of MI percentage are mostly similar. Although the location differences of MI under other constant conditions have similar impact on the ejection fraction, they also lead to dissimilar variations in the LV flow pattern and other indicators. The presented model showed a capable computational method for investigating various mechanical MI conditions with respect to cardiac flow pattern. The perspective of this model development seems to be an applicable tool for MI clinical diagnosis and prediction of complications related to MI.}

Although these models have been able to predict the correct steady-state solid-phase concentration profile, none have been able to follow the transient experimentally measured concentration profile over a range of suspended particle radii with a consistent set of diffusion coefficients. In this research, two improvements are made to the diffusive-flux model, namely, modeling the diffusion coefficients as linear functions of the so-called nonlinearity parameter and adding slip boundary conditions at the wall. A particle-level explanation for the linear dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the nonlinearity parameter is provided. With these two improvements, it is shown that the modified diffusive flux model can accurately predict the transient solid-phase concentration profile in a Couette device over a wide range of particle radii.},

  abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

The algorithm is here applied in conjunction with a finite-volume technique employing a backward temporal difference scheme to the computation of compressible and incompressible flow cases. The results of calculations are compared with similar ones obtained with an existing iterative method. It is shown that for time-evolving flows the splitting error of PISO is negligibly small at the level of time-step required to eliminate the temporal truncation error, while the avoidance of iteration results in a substantial reduction in computing effort over that required by iterative methods. It is also demonstrated that PISO is stable for fairly large time steps, which renders it useful for steady-state calculations as well.},

Especially challenging are submillimetre air bubbles in water due to their large density contrast and dominance of surface tension. Here, we evaluate two numerical methods implemented in OpenFOAM\textregistered, namely the standard solver interFoam with an algebraic volume-of-fluid method relying on a sharp interface representation and phaseFieldFoam relying on the phase-field method with diffuse interface representation. For a circular bubble in static equilibrium, we explore the impacts of uniform grid resolution and bubble size on bubble shape, mass conservation, pressure jump and spurious currents. While the standard interFoam solver exhibits excellent mass conservation with errors below 0.1\% on fine grids, it lacks the accuracy to predict reasonable physics for a bubble in microfluidic systems. At higher resolution, large spurious currents significantly displace and deform the bubble, which is oscillating with resolution dependent mode and frequency. Furthermore, the pressure jump is consistently underestimated by more than 10\%. The solver phaseFieldFoam suffers from much larger mass losses of up to 2\%, which decrease as the ratio between interface thickness and bubble diameter decreases provided the diffuse interface region is adequately resolved. Spurious currents are very low and the bubble remains circular preserving its initial position with an error in pressure jump below 1\%.},

A 3D fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) model in a compliant vessel is used to represent the pressure wave propagation. The 3D fluid is described through a shear-thinning generalized Newtonian model and the structure by a nonlinear hyperelastic model. In order to cope with the spurious reflections due to the truncation of the computational domain, several absorbing boundary conditions are analyzed. First, a 1D hyperbolic model that effectively captures the wave propagation nature of blood flow in arteries is coupled with the 3D FSI model. Extending previous results, an energy estimate is derived for the 3D FSI\textendash 1D coupling in the case of generalized Newtonian models. Secondly, absorbing boundary conditions obtained from the 1D model are imposed directly on the outflow sections of the 3D FSI model, and numerical results comparing the different absorbing conditions in an idealized vessel are presented. Results in a human carotid bifurcation reconstructed from medical images are also provided in order to show that the proposed methodology can be applied to anatomically realistic geometries.},

  abstract = {Measurement of small changes in platelet activation state (P AS) in circulating stenotic systems in vitro has been problematic because of a paucity of real-time assay methods and circulation systems of low platelet-activating potential. p AS was measured by a modified prothrombinase assay in which activated platelets provide the essential cofactors in the activation of prothrombin by factor Xa. Chemical modification of the prothrombin ensures that the thrombin produced, while assayable, does not activate platelets. Human platelets were circulated in loops in which exposure to shear stress was adjusted by independently varying flow rate, viscosity, and the time of exposure to shear. Although with some differences in platelet response to different conditions of stress, the p AS directly increased with time of circulation, shear stress, and time of exposure to shear. The results show that low-Ievel platelet activation caused by shear stress in a circulation loop can be quantitatively assessed in near-real time in a system of tube geometry . They confirm previous results obtained in non-circulating systems that exposure of platelets to shear conditions on the same order as found in the vasculature causes significant platelet activation, and that this activation is dependent on both shear stress and time of exposure.}

The medium under investigation is contained in a dielectric cell which is part of the tuned circuit of an oscillator. The change in frequency of the oscillator on application of a square pulse of electric field is measured using a commercial computing counter. The averaging facility of the counter allows up to 10 determinations in one sequence. The measured effect is shown to be the sum of the NDE plus a Joule heating effect due to the conductance of the liquid. The true NDE is determined by extrapolation of the data to zero pulse width while the rate of change of the total effect plus a residual effect after the pulse gives information on the heating. It is shown that the heating of the liquid between the electrodes is an adiabatic process\{,\} the time of diffusion of the heat to the rest of the cell being large compared with the time of the experiment. Illustrative results are given for acetone\{,\} hexanol and dodecanol. In addition the precise measurements of the heating effect can be used for the determination of high field conductivities and thermometric\{,\} calorimetric etc. measurements in suitable cases.},

However, their distribution with red blood cells (RBCs) and leukocytes is not so well studied and understood. Our three-phase computational fluid dynamics approach including plasma, RBCs, and leukocytes was used to numerically simulate the local hemodynamics in such a flow regime. This model has tracked the wall shear stress (WSS), phase distributions, and flow patterns for each phase in a concentrated suspension shear flow of blood. Unlike other computational approaches, this approach does not require dispersion coefficients as an input. The non-Newtonian viscosity model was applied to a wide physiological range of hematocrits, including low shear rates. The migration and segregation of blood cells in disturbed flow regions were computed, and the results compared favorably with available experimental data. The predicted higher leukocyte concentration was correlated with relatively low WSS near the stenosis having a high WSS. This behavior was attributed to flow-dependent interactions of the leukocytes with RBCs in pulsatile flow. This three-phase hemodynamic analysis may have application to vulnerable plaque formation in arteries with in vivo complex flow conditions.},

  abstract = {This study documents the superior hemodynamics of a novel coupled sequential anastomoses (SQA) graft design in comparison with the routine conventional end-to-side (ETS) anastomoses in coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). The flow fields inside three polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) models of coronary artery bypass grafts, including the coupled SQA graft design, a conventional ETS anastomosis, and a parallel side-to-side (STS) anastomosis, are investigated under pulsatile flow conditions using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The velocity field and distributions of wall shear stress (WSS) in the models are studied and compared with each other. The measurement results and WSS distributions, computed from the near wall velocity gradients reveal that the novel coupled SQA design provides: (i) a uniform and smooth flow at its ETS anastomosis, without any stagnation point on the artery bed and vortex formation in the heel region of the ETS anastomosis within the coronary artery; (ii) more favorable WSS distribution; and (iii) a spare route for the blood flow to the coronary artery, to avoid re-operation in case of re-stenosis in either of the anastomoses. This in vitro investigation complements the previous computational studies of blood flow in this coupled SQA design, and is another necessary step taken toward the clinical application of this novel design. At this point and prior to the clinical adoption of this novel design, in vivo animal trials are warranted, in order to investigate the biological effects and overall performance of this anastomotic configuration in vivo.},

  abstract = {The inflammatory process of atherosclerosis leads to the formation of an atheromatous plaque in the intima of the blood vessel. The plaque rupture may result from the interaction between the blood and the plaque. In each cardiac cycle, blood interacts with the vessel, considered as a compliant nonlinear hyperelastic. A three dimensional idealized fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model is constructed to perform the blood-plaque and blood-vessel wall interaction studies. An absorbing boundary condition (BC) is imposed directly on the outflow in order to cope with the spurious reflexions due to the truncation of the computational domain. The difference between the Newtonian and non-Newtonian effects is highlighted. It is shown that the von Mises and wall shear stresses are significantly affected according to the rigidity of the wall. The numerical results have shown that the risk of plaque rupture is higher in the case of a moving wall, while in the case of a fixed wall the risk of progression of the atheromatous plaque is higher.}

  abstract = {The investigation of the bidirectional coupling between a fluid flow and a structure motion is a growing branch of research in science and industry. Applications of the so-called fluid\textendash structure interactions (FSI) are widespread. To improve coupled numerical FSI simulations, generic experimental benchmark studies of the fluid and the structure are necessary. In this work, the coupling of a vortex-induced periodic deformation of a flexible structure mounted behind a rigid cylinder and a fully turbulent water flow performed at a Reynolds number of Re=30 470 is experimentally investigated with a planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) and a volumetric three-component velocimetry (V3V) system. To determine the structure displacements a multiple-point laser triangulation sensor is used. The three-dimensional fluid velocity results show shedding vortices behind the structure, which reaches the second swiveling mode with a frequency of about 11.2 Hz corresponding to a Strouhal number of St=0.177. Providing phase-averaged flow and structure measurements precise experimental data for coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structure dynamics (CSD) validations are available for this new benchmark case denoted FSI-PfS-2a. The test case possesses four main advantages: (i) the geometry is rather simple; (ii) kinematically, the rotation of the front cylinder is avoided; (iii) the boundary conditions are well defined; (iv) nevertheless, the resulting flow features and structure displacements are challenging from the computational point of view. In addition to the flow field and displacement data a PIV-based force calculation method is used to estimate the lift and drag coefficients of the moving structure.},

  abstract = {Comparative study among aortic valves requires the use of an unbiased and relevant boundary condition. Pressure and flow boundary conditions used in literature are not sufficient for an unbiased analysis. We need a different boundary condition to analyze the valves in an unbiased, relevant environment. The proposed boundary condition is a combination of the pressure and flow boundary condition methods, which is chosen considering the demerits of the pressure and flow boundary conditions. In order to study the valve in its natural environment and to give a comparative analysis between different boundary conditions, a fluid-structure interaction analysis is made using the pressure and the proposed boundary conditions for a normal aortic valve. Commercial software LS-DYNA is used in all our analysis. The proposed boundary condition ensures a full opening of the valve with reduced valve regurgitation. It is found that for a very marginal raise in the ventricular pressure caused by pumping a fixed stroke volume, the cardiac output is considerably raised. The mechanics of the valve is similar between these two boundary conditions, however we observe that the importance of the root to raise the cardiac output may be overstated, considering the importance of the fully open nodule of arantius. Our proposed boundary condition delivers all the insights offered by the pressure and flow boundary conditions, along with providing an unbiased framework for the analysis of different valves and hence, more suitable for comparative analysis.}

At oceanic depths deeper than approximately 3000 in, liquid CO2 density is higher than the density of seawater and CO2 is expected to sink and form a pool at the ocean floor. In addition to chemical reactions between CO2 and seawater to form hydrate, fluid displacement is also expected to occur within the ocean floor sediments. In this work, we consider two different numerical models for hydrate fort-nation at the pore scale. The first model consists of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method applied to a single-phase supersaturated solution in a constructed porous medium. The second model is based on the Invasion Percolation (IP) in pore networks, applied to two-phase immiscible displacement of seawater by liquid CO2. The pore-scale results are upscaled to obtain constitutive relations for porosity, both transverse and for the entire domain, and for permeability. We examine deposition and displacement. patterns, and changes in porosity and permeability due to hydrate formation, and how these properties depend on various parameters including a parametric study of the effect of hydrate formation kinetics. According to the simulations, the depth Of CO2 invasion in the sediments is controlled by changes in the pore-scale porosity close to the hydrate formation front. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This is because of the importance of the interaction between the flowing blood and the deforming arterial wall to blood flow behaviour. Unfortunately, most of these FSI models lack rigorous validation and, thus, cannot guarantee the accuracy of their predictions. This paper presents the comprehensive validation of a two-way coupled FSI numerical model, developed to predict flow transients in compliant conduits such as arteries. The model is validated using analytical solutions and experiments conducted on polyurethane mock artery. Flow parameters such as pressure and axial stress (and precursor) wave speeds, wall deformations and oscillating frequency, fluid velocity and Poisson coupling effects, were used as the basis of this validation. Results show very good comparison between numerical predictions, analytical solutions and experimental data. The agreement between the three approaches is generally over 95\%. The model also shows accurate prediction of Poisson coupling effects in unsteady flows through flexible pipes, which up to this stage have only being predicted analytically. Therefore, this numerical model can accurately predict flow transients in compliant vessels such as arteries.},

Because these VADs produce nonpulsatile flo{$\sim$} their hemodvnamic characteristics differ from those of pulsatile devices. These differences mav have important clinical consequences, particularlv in relation to the outflow-graft configuration. We describe a computer-generated flow model that we created to illustrate the flow dvnamics and possible clinical consequences of each method. The simulations indicate that the location of the anastomosis has important qualitative effects on flow in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. At high VAD outputs (c75\%), native cardiac output cannot supplV the carotid and subclavian arteries. With a descending aortic anastomosis, net backward flow occurs in the descending aorta to supplV these branches. Consequentl{$\sim$} the aortic arch has a region with almost no net flo{$\sim$} where fluid particles stagnate over manv cardiac cvcles, possiblV causing thrombogenesis. With an ascending aortic anastomosis, the arch has no stagnant region, although flow turbulence still occurs. When the aortic valve remains closed, so that the totaloutput occurs through the VAD, the aortic root has a region of nearlv stagnant flow. With an ascending aortic anastomosis, a small degree of recirculatorv flow mav prevent complete stagnation at the aortic root. With the descending aortic anastomosis, howevet; no recirculation occurs. These results help delineate the complex flow dvnamics and the advantages and drawbacks of each technique.

  abstract = {Methods of speed control for implantable rotary blood pumps (iRBPs) are vital for providing implant recipients with sufficient blood flow to cater for their physiological requirements. The detection of pumping states that reflect the physiological state of the native heart forms a major component of such a control method. Employing data from a number of acute animal experiments, five such pumping states have been previously identified: regurgitant pump flow, ventricular ejection (VE), nonopening of the aortic valve (ANO), and partial collapse (intermittent [PVC-I] and continuous [PVC-C]) of the ventricle wall. An automated approach that noninvasively detects such pumping states, employing a classification and regression tree (CART), has also been developed. An extension to this technique, involving an investigation into the effects of cardiac rhythm disturbances on the state detection process, is discussed. When incorporating animal data containing arrhythmic events into the CART model, the strategy showed a marked improvement in detecting pumping states as compared to the model devoid of arrhythmic data: state VE\textemdash 57.4/91.7\% (sensitivity/specificity) improved to 97.1/100.0\%; state PVC-I\textemdash 66.7/83.1\% improved to 100.0/88.3\%, and state PVC-C\textemdash 11.1/66.2\% changed to 0.0/100\%. With a simplified binary scheme differentiating suction (PVC-I, PVC-C) and nonsuction (VE, ANO) states, suction was initially detected with 100/98.5\% sensitivity/specificity, whereas with the subsequent improved model, both these states were detected with 100\% sensitivity. The accuracy achieved demonstrates the robustness of the technique presented, and substantiates its inclusion into any iRBP control methodology.},

Their unusual facies, stratigraphically abrupt basal and upper contacts, and strongly negative carbon isotopic signature ({$\delta$}13C values between {$\sim$}0\textperthousand{} and -5\textperthousand ) suggest a chemical oceanographic origin, the details of which remain unresolved. Here we propose that these enigmatic deposits are related to the destabilization of gas hydrate in terrestrial permafrost following rapid postglacial warming and flooding of widely exposed continental shelves and interior basins. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis includes (1) the common occurrence within the cap carbonates of unusual fabrics, similar to those produced by cold methane seeps; (2) a distinctive time evolution for the carbon isotopic excursions indicative of a pulse addition of isotopically depleted carbon to the ocean- atmosphere system; and (3) agreement between mass-balance estimates of carbon released by hydrate destabilization and carbon buried in the cap carbonate. We infer that during times of low-latitude glaciation, characteristic of the Neoproterozoic, gas hydrates may have been in greater abundance than at any other time in Earth history.},

Formation, growth and decay of vortices during the myocardial dilation are analyzed with flow patterns on various diametric planes. They are dominated by momentum transfer during flow acceleration and deceleration through the mitral orifice. The posterior and anterior vortices form an asymmetric annular vortex at the mitral orifice, providing a smooth transition for the rapid inflow to the ventricle. The development of core vortex accommodates momentum for deceleration and for acceleration at end diastolic atrial contraction. The rate of energy dissipation and that of work done by viscous stresses are small; they are approximately balanced with each other. The kinetic energy flux and the rate of work done by pressure delivered to blood from ventricular dilation is well balanced by the total energy influx at the mitral orifice and the rate change of kinetic energy in the ventricle.},

Their optical properties are reported to be dependent on the size, which imparts different colors due to absorption in the visible region. Their reactivity, toughness and other properties are also dependent on their unique size, shape and structure. Due to these characteristics, they are suitable candidates for various commercial and domestic applications, which include catalysis, imaging, medical applications, energy-based research, and environmental applications.

The BCM was connected to a true size silicon rubber aorta and operated by an intra-aortic balloon pump. We examined the performance of the device at two system pressures (6.5 and 8 kPa); at three heart rates (60,80, and 100 bpm); and at three pumping frequencies (1:1, 1:2, 1:3). Pressure and flow were measured in the upper descending aorta, and wave intensity analysis was used to calculate the peak intensity and energy of the compression and expansion waves. Pressure and flow waveforms produced by the BCM LVAD in vitro under different loading conditions were similar to those observed in vivo under similar loadings. Pusher-plate-type LVADs can produce compression and expansion waves similar to those generated by healthy LV in vivo.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helical and retrograde secondary flows have been recorded in the aorta, but their origins and movements in relation to the arch have not been clarified. We set out to do this using magnetic resonance velocity mapping. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-directional phase contrast cine magnetic resonance velocity mapping was used to map multidirectional flow velocities in the aortas of 10 healthy volunteers. Computer processing was used to visualize flow vector patterns in selected planes. Right-handed helical flows predominated in the upper aortic arch in late systole, being clearly recognizable in 9 of the 10 subjects. Nonaxial components of velocity in this region reached 0.29 m/s (+/- 0.05 m/s) as axial velocities declined from a peak of 1.0 m/s (+/- 0.1 m/s). Helical flow patterns in the upper descending aorta varied between subjects, apparently depending on arch curvature. End-systolic retrograde flow originated from regions of blood with low momentum, usually along inner wall curvatures. Flow studies in a curved tubular phantom showed right-handed helical flow in the upper "arch" when the inflow section was positioned to simulate ascending aortic curvature, and retrograde flow occurred along the inner wall at end systole during pulsatile flow. CONCLUSIONS: Helical and retrograde streams are consistent features of intra-aortic flow in healthy subjects that result, at least in part, from the curvature of the arch and the pulsatility of flow in it. They may have significance in relation to circulatory dynamics and the pathogenesis of atheroma in the arch.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance velocity mapping was used to investigate the hypothesis of a vortex motion within the left ventricle interacting with mitral valve motion and inflow velocity. BACKGROUND: In vitro flow visualization studies have suggested the presence of a large anterior vortex inside the left ventricle during mitral inflow. However, to our knowledge the occurrence of this phenomenon has not been demonstrated in the human left ventricle. METHODS: Magnetic resonance velocity mapping was performed in 26 healthy volunteers using a flow-adjusted gradient sequence for three-dimensional flow velocity acquisition in the long-axis plane of the left ventricle. By computer processing, the flow vectors in the left ventricle were visualized and animated dynamically. RESULTS: The early diastolic mitral inflow was apically directed, and a large counterclockwise anterior vortex was created within the left ventricle shortly after the onset of the mid-diastolic semiclosure of the anterior mitral leaflet. During mid-diastolic diastasis, mitral inflow ceased until the flow accelerated again at atrial systole. The final closure of the mitral valve was preceded by a smaller vortex seen at the tips of the mitral leaflets. At systolic ejection, all flow vectors were directed toward the left ventricular outflow tract. The anterior vortex had a radius of 1.62 0.24 cm (mean SD), and the average angular velocity (i.e., the rotation of an element about the center of the vortex within the central core) was 30.08 9.98 radians/s. The maximal kinetic energy of the anterior vortex was 4.3 x 10(-4) 7.1 x 10(-5) J. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis of a diastolic vortex formation in the human left ventricle was confirmed, and its close temporal relation to the motion of the anterior mitral leaflet was demonstrated.},

In this paper, we employ a noniterative subspace model identification (SMI) algorithm to estimate parameters in a three- and four-element windkessel model by application of physical foreknowledge. Simulation data of the systemic circulation were used to investigate systematic and random errors in the parameter estimations. Results were compared with different methods as proposed in the literature: one closed-loop and two iterative methods for the three-element model, and one iterative method for the four-element model. For the three-element model, no significant systematic errors were observed using SMI. Concerning random errors, SMI appeared more robust in parameter estimations compared with the other methods ( P {$<$}; 0.05 for a signal-to-noise ratio of 18 dB). For the four-element model, a significant systematic error in the estimate of the arterial inertance L was observed (P = 0.011). However, for all methods, an increasing number of outliers in parameter estimates were observed at increased noise levels. These outliers were almost exclusive due to errors in estimates of L. In conclusion, with SMI physical parameters can mathematically be derived by application of physiological foreknowledge. For a three-element windkessel model, SMI appeared a very robust method to estimate parameters. However, application to a four-element windkessel model was less accurate because of low identifiability of L. Therefore, based on the simulation results, the use of the four-element windkessel model is questionable.},

  abstract = {[1] Review of the literature reveals that the nature of pore-scale interactions between gas hydrates and porous media remains a matter of controversy. To clarify the situation, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements have been made on methane hydrate-bearing sandstones. The samples were synthetically prepared within the gas hydrate stability zone, at or near the seafloor in Monterey Bay, California. The method simulated natural hydrate deposition by gas flows that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium with the surrounding earth. The efficiency of hydrate production was variable, as has been observed elsewhere. When substantial hydrate saturations were achieved, NMR relaxation time measurements indicated that hydrate tended to replace water in the largest pore spaces. The relative permeability to water, as determined by an NMR-based correlation, was significantly reduced. The magnitude of this reduction was also consistent with formation of hydrate in the centers of pores, rather than with hydrate coating the grains. The growth habit suggested by these results is consistent with creation of hydrate nodules and lenses in coarse, unconsolidated sediments. It is also consistent with scenarios in which methane gas is delivered efficiently to the atmosphere as a result of seafloor slope failure, thereby strengthening global warming feedback mechanisms.},

Methods and Results\textendash{} Hearts were obtained at transplant from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) not requiring LVAD support (n=30), patients requiring LVAD support (n=16; LVAD duration, 145\{+/-\}33 days), and 5 nonfailing hearts. Left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) ex vivo pressure-volume relationships were measured, and chamber and myocardial stiffness constants were determined. Myocardial tissue content of total and cross-linked collagen, collagen types I and III, MMP-1, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and angiotensin (Ang) I and II were measured. LV size, mass, and myocyte diameter decreased after LVAD compared with DCM without LVAD (P{$<$}0.05). Total and cross-linked collagen and ratio of type I to III collagen increased in DCM compared with nonfailing hearts and increased further after LVAD (P{$<$}0.05 versus DCM and nonfailing). Concomitantly, chamber and myocardial stiffness increased with LVAD. The ratio of MMP-1 to TIMP-1 increased in DCM and almost normalized after LVAD, favoring decreased collagen degradation. Tissue Ang I and II also increased during LVAD. There was no significant change in the RV of LVAD-supported heart compared with DCM. Conclusions\textendash{} LVAD support increases LV collagen cross-linking and the ratio of collagen type I to III, which is associated with increased myocardial stiffness. Decreased tissue MMP-1-to-TIMP-1 ratio (decreased degradation) and increased Ang levels (stimulants of synthesis) are likely mechanisms for these changes. Lack of significant effects on the RV suggest that hemodynamic unloading of the LV (not provided to the RV) might be the primary factor that regulates these extracellular matrix changes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) with continuous flow properties are increasingly used to bridge heart failure patients to cardiac transplantation. Advantages in comparison with the pulsatile LVADs are smaller size, better endurance, and lower thromboembolic events. However, whether these new pumps have similar pre- and posttransplant outcomes is not clear. METHODS: Fifty patients with a continuous flow device (Micromed DeBakey, Houston, TX or InCor BerlinHeart, Berlin, Germany) were compared with an age-, disease-, and LVAD duration-matched control group (n = 80) supported with a pulsatile device (Novacor, WorldHeart, Oakland, CA or HeartMate, Thoratec Corp, Pleasanton, CA). RESULTS: Age (44.3 +/- 13.4 vs 46.1 +/- 11.1 years), disease (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, 58\% vs 65\%), and LVAD duration (138 +/- 131 vs 128 +/- 106 days) were comparable in both groups. Successful bridging to transplantation was similar with continuous flow in comparison with pulsatile device support (52\% vs 56\%, p = not significant [NS]). Thirty-day mortality after cardiac transplantation in patients with continuous flow LVAD support was 21.7\% vs 22.2\% with pulsatile LVADs (p = NS). Reasons for death were similar among the different LVAD groups. Long-term survival was similar in both LVAD groups compared with patients without previous LVAD support. Interestingly, severe rejections were significantly more frequent in patients with a continuous flow LVAD (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The new generation of cardiac assist devices with continuous flow pattern has a similar rate of pre- and posttransplant mortality in comparison with pulsatile LVADs. However, the rate and severity of posttransplant rejection was significantly higher in the group with continuous flow devices. Further studies are warranted to explain the higher rate of severe rejections.}

  abstract = {The effects of transport properties (viscosity and thermal conductivity) and surface roughness were compared experimentally to investigate non-self-similar Mach reflection phenomena in weak shock waves. The effect of the transport properties was changed by varying the initial pressure ahead of the incident shock in experiments conducted at Karlsruhe (KIT) and Saitama (SIT). By introducing a non-dimensional distance based on physical properties behind the Mach stem, the difference between the results under various experimental conditions was diminished, and in some cases the results almost coincide with each other within the error in angle measurement. In order to investigate the effect of surface roughness, further experiments were conducted at SIT using models with rough surfaces. The results were compared with those for smooth surfaces. The effect of surface roughness turned out to be small compared with the viscosity effect, proving the effect of transport properties to be dominant. The fact that the discrepancies between the SIT and KIT experiments vanished after introducing the non-dimensional coordinate may possibly be ascribed to inaccuracy in angle measurement at KIT. \textcopyright{} 2011 by National Committee for IUTAM.},

  abstract = {Numerical modeling of the human cardiovascular system has always been an active research direction since the 19th century. In the past, various simulation models of different complexities were proposed for different research purposes. In this paper, an improved numerical model to study the dynamic function of the human circulation system is proposed. In the development of the mathematical model, the heart chambers are described with a variable elastance model. The systemic and pulmonary loops are described based on the resistance\textendash compliance\textendash inertia concept by considering local effects of flow friction, elasticity of blood vessels and inertia of blood in different segments of the blood vessels. As an advancement from previous models, heart valve dynamics and atrioventricular interaction, including atrial contraction and motion of the annulus fibrosus, are specifically modeled. With these improvements the developed model can predict several important features that were missing in previous numerical models, including regurgitant flow on heart valve closure, the value of E/A velocity ratio in mitral flow, the motion of the annulus fibrosus (called the KG diaphragm pumping action), etc. These features have important clinical meaning and their changes are often related to cardiovascular diseases. Successful simulation of these features enhances the accuracy of simulations of cardiovascular dynamics, and helps in clinical studies of cardiac function.},

For the RBCs, we propose a nodal projective FEM (npFEM) solver which has theoretical advantages over the more commonly used mass-spring systems (mesoscopic modeling), such as an unconditional stability, versatile material expressivity, and one set of parameters to fully describe the behavior of the body at any mesh resolution. At the same time, the method is substantially faster than other FEM solvers proposed in this field, and has an efficiency that is comparable to the one of mesoscopic models. At its core, the solver uses specially defined potential energies, and builds upon them a fast iterative procedure based on quasi-Newton techniques. For a known material, our solver has only one free parameter that demands tuning, related to the body viscoelasticity. In contrast, state-of-the-art solvers for deformable bodies have more free parameters, and the calibration of the models demands special assumptions regarding the mesh topology, which restrict their generality and mesh independence. We propose as well a modification to the potential energy proposed by Skalak et al. 1973 for the red blood cell membrane, which enhances the strain hardening behavior at higher deformations. Our viscoelastic model for the red blood cell, while simple enough and applicable to any kind of solver as a post-convergence step, can capture accurately the characteristic recovery time and tank-treading frequencies. The framework is validated using experimental data, and it proves to be scalable for multiple deformable bodies.},

The motion of coloured tracer particles of a size different from the bulk suspension is followed as a function of time. The tracer particles are seen to experience a constant drift velocity independent of their radial position. This is in addition to the random-walk motion arising from their interactions with other particles in the suspension. These observations are found to be consistent with the shear-induced migration model of Leighton \& Acrivos (1987 a,b) as well as the tracer diffusivity measurements of Phan \& Leighton (1996). In the experiments of Abbott et al. (1991), it was observed that larger particles migrated radially outward to regions of lower shear stress in a wide-gap Couette device. In our experiments large tracers were also observed to migrate radially outward. In this case, however, the radial migration resulted in migration to regions of higher shear stress, contrary to expectations. This apparent discrepancy is explained in terms of a model that incorporates both the stress-induced migration of earlier studies and a curvature-induced migration flux (which in turn is shear-induced) as an opposing effect.},

  abstract = {Statistically, heart disease has been the major cause of death in the recent past, which emphasizes the need for computational heart models. In this context, the so-called KaHMo (Karlsruhe Heart Model) is specialized on the innerventricular blood flow and its influence on the overall heart conditions. Both healthy and diseased hearts are simulated in order to analyze characteristic flow patterns and pressure losses. The patient-specific fluid domain movement is realized by time-dependent geometries out of MRI data. However, in order to capture flow changes due to structural variations, a multi-physical simulation approach is of utmost importance. Consequently, the model extension KaHMo FSI includes macroscopic structural properties using a hyperelastic finite element composite. The partitioned code coupling strategy allows the combination of separated software packages specialized for both the fluid and structural domain respectively. The interaction of blood flow and constitutive behavior influences the interface movement for both relaxation and contraction. In this context, the energetic equilibrium between the computational fluid and structural domain requires kinematic and dynamic coupling conditions to be satisfied continuously. The focus of this work is on the first application of patientspecific reference geometry for KaHMo FSI. The coupled flow simulation is compared to corresponding results from KaHMo's standard fluid domain movement. In order to validate the flow simulation itself a further test-case model is evaluated and compared to experimental flow measurements. A detailed understanding of hydro-elastic blood/soft-tissue interaction is important for future therapy planning.},

  abstract = {Although there are many uncertainties in hydrate dissociation process in porous media, numerical simulation gives useful information in evaluating economically feasible gas recovery processes from gas hydrate reservoirs. Furthermore, there are several unknown parameters involved in the numerical model and determination of accurate values of these parameters is essential for reliable production forecasts. One of these parameters is the variation of permeability of the porous media in the presence of hydrates. In this study the permeability to gas was experimentally determined at varying hydrate saturations in a porous medium made of packed glass beads. By comparing the experimentally determined permeability with those calculated using the empirical permeability correlations it was found that for initial water saturations less than 35\%, hydrate tends to form on the grain surfaces. However, for initial water saturations greater than 35\%, the experimental results indicate a pore filling tendency of hydrate formation. The experimental permeability values were also correlated with the Masuda et al.'s (1997) permeability model and a value of 3.0 was obtained for the permeability reduction exponent. To evaluate the impact of permeability reduction exponent on the dissociation process, a one-dimensional numerical model was developed for dissociation of gas hydrates in porous media by depressurization. The numerical model includes the three mechanisms i.e. kinetics of hydrate decomposition, heat transfer and fluid now; that might be associated with the dissociation of hydrates in porous medium. The effect of permeability reduction exponent on the dissociation characteristics of hydrate was analyzed using this simulator. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) causing increased morbidity. Although atherosclerosis is a general disease involving several factors, it preferentially affects the wall of the vessel bifurcations. The use of advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques has the potential to shed more light in the further understanding of the causes of the disease and perhaps in its early diagnosis. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) study was carried out for a patient specific carotid artery. By considering physiological conditions, first the normal and then with hypertension disease, haemodynamic parameters were evaluated to better understand the genesis and progression of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery bifurcation. Two-way FSI was performed by applying a fully implicit second-order backward Euler differencing scheme using commercial software ANSYS and ANSYS CFX (version 19.0). Arbitrary Lagrangian\textendash Eulerian (ALE) formulation was employed to calculate the arterial response by using the temporal blood response. Due to arterial bifurcation, obvious velocity reduction and backflow formation were observed which decreased shear stress and made it oscillatory at the starting point of the internal carotid artery near the carotid sinus, which resulted in low shear stress. Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI) signifies oscillatory behaviour of artery wall shear stress. By using anatomically realistic 3D geometry and representative physiological conditions, the results obtained for shear stress are more acceptable. Comparison of the results of this study with those in the published literature shows that the regions with low wall shear stress and with OSI value greater than 0.3 pose potential risk to the development of plaques. It was observed that haemodynamics of the carotid artery was very much affected by the geometry and flow conditions. Furthermore, regions of relatively low wall shear stress were observed post stenosis, which is a known cause of plaque development and progression.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The potential effects of naturally occurring gas hydrate on humans are not understood with certainty, but enough information has been acquired over the past 30 years to make preliminary assessments possible. Three major issues are gas hydrate as (1) a potential energy resource, (2) a factor in global climate change, and (3) a submarine geohazard. The methane content is estimated to be between 1015 to 1017 m3 at STP and the worldwide distribution in outer continental margins of oceans and in polar regions are significant features of gas hydrate. However, its immediate development as an energy resource is not likely because there are various geological constraints and difficult technological problems that must be solved before economic recovery of methane from hydrate can be achieved. The role of gas hydrate in global climate change is uncertain. For hydrate methane to be an effective greenhouse gas, it must reach the atmosphere. Yet there are many obstacles to the transfer of methane from hydrate to the atmosphere. Rates of gas hydrate dissociation and the integrated rates of release and destruction of the methane in the geo/hydro/atmosphere are not adequately understood. Gas hydrate as a submarine geohazard, however, is of immediate and increasing importance to humans as our industrial society moves to exploit seabed resources at ever-greater depths in the waters of our coastal oceans. Human activities and installations in regions of gas-hydrate occurrence must take into account the presence of gas hydrate and deal with the consequences of its presence.},

In this circuit the methane hydrate is a condenser and the consequences of methane hydrate dissociation are depicted as a resistor and inductor, reflecting temperature change and changes in earth surface history. These consequences may have implications for global change including global climate change.Terra Nova, 14, 302\textendash 306, 2002},

  abstract = {Methane (CH4) is the most abundant organic compound in the Earth's atmosphere, where it acts as a greenhouse gas and thus has implications for global climate change. The current atmospheric CH4 budget, however, does not take into account geologically-sourced CH4 seepage. Geological sources of CH4 include natural macro- and micro-seeps, mud volcanoes, and other miscellaneous sources such as gas hydrates, magmatic volcanoes, geothermal regions, and mid-ocean ridges. Macro-seeps contribute similar to 25 Tg (teragrams) CH4/yr to the atmosphere, whereas, micro-seepage contributes perhaps 7 Tg CH4/yr. Mud volcanoes emit similar to 5 Tg CH4/yr, and miscellaneous sources emit similar to 8 Tg CH4/yr to the atmosphere. Thus, the total contribution to the atmosphere from geological sources is estimated to be 45 Tg CH4/yr, which is significant to the atmospheric organic carbon cycle and should be included in any global inventory of atmospheric CH4. We argue that the atmospheric CH4 global inventory of the Interplanetary Panel on Climate Change must be adjusted in order to incorporate geologically-sourced CH4 from naturally occurring seepage.

Fetal intracardiac flows are especially useful for gaining insights into the development of congenital heart diseases, but have not received due attention thus far, most likely because of technical difficulties in collecting sufficient intracardiac flow data in a safe manner. Here, we circumvent such obstacles by employing 4D STIC ultrasound scans to quantify the fetal heart motion in three normal 20-week fetuses, subsequently performing 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations on the left ventricles based on these patient-specific heart movements. Analysis of the simulation results shows that there are significant differences between fetal and adult ventricular blood flows which arise because of dissimilar heart morphology, E/A ratio, diastolic-systolic duration ratio, and heart rate. The formations of ventricular vortex rings were observed for both E- and A-wave in the flow simulations. These vortices had sufficient momentum to last until the end of diastole and were responsible for generating significant wall shear stresses on the myocardial endothelium, as well as helicity in systolic outflow. Based on findings from previous studies, we hypothesized that these vortex-induced flow properties play an important role in sustaining the efficiency of diastolic filling, systolic pumping, and cardiovascular flow in normal fetal hearts.},

Compliance values estimated by WK4 were decreased by 5\% comparatively to WK3 (P = 0.008). However, this difference can be considered as not physiologically relevant. Values of characteristic resistance corresponding to R 1 + (L/R 2 C) in WK4 and to R 1 in WK3 were not different (P = 0.22). The relative changes in R 1, R 2, and C observed due to the different experimental conditions were comparable regardless of the model.

  abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study in which several partitioned solution procedures for incompressible fluid-structure interaction are compared and validated against the results of an experimental fluid-structure interaction benchmark. The numerical methods discussed cover the three main families of coupling schemes: strongly coupled, semi-implicit, and loosely coupled. Very good agreement is observed between the numerical and experimental results. The comparisons confirm that strong coupling can be efficiently avoided, via semi-implicit and loosely coupled schemes, without compromising stability and accuracy.

Several state-of-the-art partitioned solution procedures for incompressible fluid-structure interaction are thoroughly compared and validated against experimental data. The considered methods are parameter free and cover the three main categories of coupling schemes: strongly coupled, semi-implicit and loosely coupled. Previous studies in this direction used synthetic data as reference or were limited to a single method. Very good agreement is observed between the numerical and experimental results.},

  abstract = {In recent years, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations on in-silico models of the heart have provided a valuable insight into cardiac hemodynamic behaviour. However, so far most models have been either based on simplified geometries or on imaging acquisitions with relatively low temporal resolution. It has been suggested that models based entirely on subject-specific ultrasonic images should be used to capture transient flow changes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present a pathway from routine 4D echocardiography to a patient-specific flow simulation of the left ventricle (LV), evaluating the model robustness and clinical feasibility. The created pathway consisted of initial LV segmentation and mitral/aortic valve positioning, being subsequently used as input for the CFD simulations (based on solving the Navier-Stokes equation using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach). The output consisted of 4D blood flow velocities and relative pressures in the entire LV. On five subjects, the model robustness was evaluated with regards to variations in singular boundary conditions. The clinical feasibility of the output was compared to clinical PW Doppler measurements and, as a proof-of-concept, synthetic contrast enhanced ultrasound images were simulated on the flow field using the COLE-method. Results indicated a relatively robust model, with variations in regional flow of approximately 5.1/6.2\% and 9.7/7.0\% for healthy and pathological subject respectively (end diastole/end systole). Furthermore, showing similar behaviour to clinical Doppler measurements the technique serves as a promising tool for future clinical investigations. Additionally, the ability of simulating synthetic ultrasound images further underlines the applicability of the pathway, being potentially useful in studies on improved echocardiographic image analysis.},

  abstract = {Valvular heart diseases are growing concern in impoverished parts of the world, such as Southern-Africa, claiming more than 31 \% of total deaths related to cardiovascular diseases. The ability to model the effects of regurgitant and obstructive lesions on the valve body can assist clinicians in preparing personalised treatments. In the present work, a multi-compartment lumped parameter model of the human cardiovascular system is developed, with a newly proposed valve modelling approach which accounts for geometry and flow regime dependent pressure drops along with the valve cusp motion. The model is applied to study various degrees of aortic stenosis using typical human cardiovascular parameters. The results generated with the proposed model, are compared to predictions using previously published valve modelling approaches and both sets of results are compared to typical local and global physiological parameters found in literature such left-ventricular systolic pressures, peak and mean aortic valve pressure drops and vena contracta velocities. The results show that the previously published valve models under predicts expected severely stenosed peak and mean transvalvular pressure drops by approximately 47\% and 30\% respectively, whereas the newly proposed model under predicts the peak pressure drop by 20\% and over predicts mean pressure drop by 7\%.},

The present study proposes a parameter discovery approach based on a lumped parameter model of the cardiovascular system in conjunction with optimization and non-invasive, clinical input measurements to approximate important cardiac parameters, including left ventricle elastances. Important parameters pertaining to ventricular function was estimated using gradient optimisation. Forward-mode automatic differentiation was used to estimate the Jacobian matrices and compared to the common finite differences approach. Synthetic data of healthy and diseased hearts were generated as proxies for non-invasive clinical measurements and used to evaluate the algorithm. Twelve parameters including left ventricle elastances were selected for optimization based on 99\% explained variation in mean left ventricle pressure and volume. The hybrid optimization strategy yielded the best overall results compared to 1st order optimization with automatic differentiation and finite difference approaches, with mean absolute percentage errors ranging from 6.67\% to 14.14\%. Errors in left ventricle elastance estimates for simulated aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation were smallest when including synthetic measurements for arterial pressure and valvular flow rate at approximately 2\% and degraded to roughly 5\% when including volume trends as well. However, the latter resulted in better tracking of the left ventricle pressure waveforms and may be considered when the necessary equipment is available.},

The geometry of the left ventricle is reconstructed from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The heart wall motion is modeled by a cell-based activation methodology, which yields physiologic kinematics with heart rate equal to 52 beats per minute. We show that the structure of the mitral vortex ring consists of the main vortex ring and trailing vortex tubes, which originate at the heart wall. The trailing vortex tubes play an important role in exciting twisting circumferential instability modes of the mitral vortex ring. At the end of diastole, the vortex ring impinges on the wall and the intraventricular flow transitions to a weak turbulent state. Our results can be used to help interprete and analyze three-dimensional in-vivo flow measurements obtained with MRI.},

With this value, the experimental results were in good agreement with the calculated ones based on the van der Waals and Platteeuw model. A correction term for the capillary effect and a Pitzer model for electrolyte solutions were adopted to calculate the activity of water in the aqueous electrolyte solutions within silica gel pores. At a specified temperature, three-phase H-L(W)-V equilibrium curves of pore hydrates were shifted to higher-pressure regions depending on pore sizes and NaCl concentrations. From the cage-dependent (13)C NMR chemical shifts of enclathrated guest molecules, the mixed CH(4) (90\%) + C(3)H(8) (10\%) gas hydrate was confirmed to be structure II.},

The 13C chemical shifts of the guest atoms in the hydrate are different from those in the free form, with some carbon atoms shifting specifically upfield. Such changes can be attributed to conformational changes upon fitting the large guest molecules in hydrate cages and/or interactions between the guests and the water molecules of the hydrate cages. In addition, powder X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that for the hexagonal unit cell, the lattice parameter along the a-axis changes with guest hydrate former molecule size and shape (in the range of 0.1 \dbend ) but a much smaller change in the c-axis (in the range of 0.01 \dbend ) is observed. The 13C NMR chemical shifts for the pure hydrocarbons and all conformers were calculated using the gauge invariant atomic orbital method at the MP2/6-311\dbend G(2d,p) level of theory to quantify the variation of the chemical shifts with the dihedral angles of the guest molecules. Calculated and measured chemical shifts are compared to determine the relative contribution of changes in the conformation and guest-water interactions to the change in chemical shift of the guest upon clathrate hydrate formation. Understanding factors that affect experimental chemical shifts for the enclathrated hydrocarbons will help in assigning spectra for complex hydrates recovered from natural sites.},

To solve the equation of motion for the structure in typical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, it is necessary to calculate the fluid force on the surface of the structure explicitly. To avoid complexity due to the necessity of additional mechanical constraints, we use the combined formulation including both the fluid and structure equations of motion into a single coupled variational equation. The Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow are solved using a P2P1 Galerkin finite element method (FEM) and mesh movement is achieved using arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation. The Newmark method is employed to solve the dynamic equilibrium equations for linear elastic solid mechanics. The time-dependent, three-dimensional, incompressible flows of Newtonian fluids constrained in the flexible wall are analyzed. The study shows strongly skewed axial velocity and flow separation in the internal carotid artery (ICA). Flow separation results in locally low wall shear stress. Further, strong secondary motion in the ICA is observed.},

Its varia tion due to changing systolic and diastolic blood pressures in hypertension and subsequent vasodilation has not been investigated. The authors examined this aspect by combining an animal experiment and a recently established nonlinear windkessel model of the arterial system that incorporates a pressure-dependent arterial compliance, C(P). Aortic pressure and flow were simultaneously mea sured in experimental dogs during control and during methoxamine-induced hypertension and nitroprusside-induced vasodilation. A numerical procedure was implemented to compute the nonlinear compliance and account for the pressure dependence. Results show that within the cardiac cycle, C(P) reached its maximum at end-systole and increased in diastole when diastolic aortic pres sure decayed. The magnitude of C(P) and its variation within the cardiac cycle was larger at low pressures, while the reverse was found when blood pressure was high. C(P) decreased significantly in hypertension and increased during subsequent vasodilation.}

The results show that the gas production process consists of three periods: the free gas production, the hydrate dissociation, and the general gas reservoir production. The hydrate dissociation accompanies the temperature decrease with the injection of the brine (NaCl solution), and the dissociation duration is shortened with the increase of the salinity. With the injection of hot brine, instantaneous hydrate dissociation rate also increases with the increase of the salinity. However, while the NaCl concentration is beyond a certain value, the rate has no longer continued increasing. Thermal efficiency and energy ratio for the hydrate production can be enhanced by injecting hot brine, and the enhanced effectiveness is quite good with the injection of high salinity at lower temperature.},

Mass transport, intrinsic kinetic reaction and energy conservation are included in the governing equations, which are discretized using the finite difference method and are solved in the implicit pressure-explicit saturation (IMPES) method. A series of simulations are performed to study the effect of several parameters, including initial gas saturation, outlet pressure, surrounding temperature, and absolute permeability, on the behavior of hydrate dissociation in the laboratory-scale system. The results show that a fast hydrate dissociation rate can be induced by the factors including high initial gas saturation, low outlet pressure, high surrounding temperature and high absolute permeability. On the other hand, it can be found that a lower outlet pressure and higher initial gas saturation can result in a higher amount of final cumulative gas production; however, final cumulative gas production can not be affected by the change of overburden heat transfer and absolute permeability. The depressurization is proved to be more effective than other techniques in the exploitation of the hydrate reservoir with higher initial gas saturation.},

Further inspection of the behavior of these interstitial H(2)O molecules has revealed that they are relatively highly mobile entities within a gas hydrate. In this paper, we report these observations and examine the molecular mechanisms responsible for the transport of these interstitial molecules through hydrate crystals. Four distinct pathways for the H(2)O molecule transport between cages are found, each facilitated by the presence of empty cages. The relative richness of the observed behavior of interstitial defects suggests that interstitial diffusion could be an important mechanism for the mass transport of H(2)O molecules through gas hydrates.},

Velocity measurements were done in the model with a two component laser-Doppler-anemometer in steady and pulsatile flow using a calcium chloride solution with a viscosity of eta = 3.18 mPas and density of rho = 1.28 kg/m3 at 20 degrees C. The time average Reynolds numbers over a whole cycle in the ascending aorta was Re = 1350. The Womersley parameter for pulsatile flow was a = 20. The pulse wave velocity in the ascending aorta was about c = 5.4 m/sec. The secondary flow behavior was discussed for steady and pulsatile flow. Reverse flows were found, especially along the inner radius of the aortic arch in the descending aorta in steady and pulsatile flow and also in small areas of the ascending aorta and at the branches of the aortic arch.

  abstract = {Background The diagnosis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) currently relies on the aortic maximal diameter, which grows in an unpredictable manner. Infrarenal aortic volume has recently become clinically feasible to measure, and an estimate of biomechanical rupture risk derived from finite element analysis, the peak wall rupture index (PWRI), has been shown to predict AAA rupture. Our objective was to ascertain how well volume growth correlates with baseline volume and increasing PWRI, compared with the maximal diameter. Methods We retrospectively identified 41 AAA patients (nine women, 32 men) at our institution who had undergone two computed tomography angiographies with an interval of 8 to 17~months. Digital three-dimensional reproductions of the aneurysms were segmented from the 82 computed tomography angiographies. AAA diameter, volume, and PWRI were measured and calculated with finite element analysis software. Growth rates of diameter and volume were related to baseline diameter and volume as well as to change rates of PWRI. Significant growth was defined as growth exceeding our interobserver 95\% limits of agreement. Results Diameter growth rate did not correlate with baseline diameter (r~= 0.15, 95\% confidence interval [CI],~-0.17 to 0.45), but volume growth rate correlated with baseline volume (r~= 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.30-0.75). The correlation between baseline volume and volume growth rate was stronger than the correlation between baseline diameter and diameter growth rate (95\% CI, 0.086-0.71). Increasing PWRI correlated with volume growth rate (r~= 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.40-0.87) but not with diameter growth rate (r~= 0.044; 95\% CI,~-0.44 to 0.51), and the difference between the correlation coefficients was significant (95\% CI, 0.11-1.16). Conclusions Volume better predicts aneurysm growth rate and correlates stronger with increasing estimated biomechanical rupture risk compared with diameter. Our results support the notion of monitoring all three dimensions of an AAA.},

This study aims to investigate the blood flow characteristics in patient-specific double aortic arches using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Seven cases of infantile patients with DAA were collected and their computed tomography images were used to reconstruct 3D computational models. A modified Carreau model was used to consider the non-Newtonian effect of blood and a three-element Windkessel model taking the effect of the age of patients into account was applied to reproduce physiological pressure waveforms. Numerical results show that blood flow distribution and energy loss of DAA depends on relative sizes of the two aortic arches and their angles with the ascending aorta. Ligation of either aortic arch increases the energy loss of blood in the DAA, leading to the increase in cardiac workload. Generally, the rising rate of energy loss before and after the surgery is almost linear with the area ratio between the aortic arch without ligation and the ascending aorta.},

The Coriolis force and other external forces are included in the model with second-order accuracy, which is consistent with the discretized accuracy of the LB equation. The numerical results show correct physics of the ocean circulation driven by the double-gyre wind stress with different Reynolds numbers and different spatial resolutions. An intrinsic low-frequency variability of the shallow water model is also found. The wind-driven ocean circulation exhibits subannual and interannual oscillations, which are comparable to those of models in which the conventional numerical methods are used.},

However, little is known about the effect of surface roughness on the antithrombogenicity of the device. The present study investigated the effect of surface roughness on the activation of the coagulation system and platelet adhesion in an impeller-type blood pump. Three identical Baylor Gyro 710 centrifugal blood pumps (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA) were manufactured with impeller surface roughness of 0.05, 0.2, and 0.4 \textmu m, respectively, as determined by a stylus profilometer and by scanning electron microscopy. Whole blood was anticoagulated (1-IU heparin/mL, ACT 250 s) and circulated for 60 min in an artificial circulatory system, simulating LVAD perfusion (5-L/min flow against 100 mm Hg). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were developed to quantify fibrinogen- and von Willebrand factor (vWf) adsorption as well as platelet adhesion directly on the impellers of the pumps. Levels of prothrombin fragment F1.2 and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex were measured in order to quantify activation of coagulation. Compared with the 0.05-\textmu m surface, platelet adhesion was 40 and 76\% higher on the 0.2- and 0.4-\textmu m surface, respectively (P {$<$} 0.01). The evaluation of adsorbed fibrinogen and vWf showed significant higher protein antigen levels on the rougher surfaces (P {$<$} 0.01). Furthermore, nonpulsatile perfusion activated the coagulation system. By contrast, the surface roughness had no significant influence on plasma prothrombin F1.2 fragment- and TAT concentrations. Antithrombogenicity was significantly reduced in pumps with inferior metal-finishing quality.}

The helical blood flow may provide guaranties for the inner surface of the ascending aortic wall to get smooth and even washing by the blood so that atherosclerotic plaques can hardly form in the area of the ascending aorta. It has been documented that the phenomenon of helical flow of blood is not just localized in the ascending aorta, it also exists in several large arteries and veins as well. Preliminary studies demonstrated the widely existing helical flow might play positive physiological roles in facilitating blood flow transport, suppressing disturbed blood flow, preventing the accumulation of atherogenic low density lipoproteins on the luminal surfaces of arteries, enhancing oxygen transport from the blood to the arterial wall and reducing the adhesion of blood cells on the arterial surface. These roles of helical blood flow may lessen the burden of arteries and protect the arteries from the pathology of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and intimal hyperplasia. The great development of time-resolved three-dimensional phase contrast MRI (flow-sensitive 4D-MRI) and the advent of dimensionless indices such as helical flow index proposed to characterize helical flow make clinic quantification of the helical flow in the human large arteries possible. Moreover, researchers probed into the possibility to apply the mechanism of helical flow to the design of vascular interventions to reduce thrombus formation and intimal hyperplasia caused by abnormal flow conditions.},

The model uses the Valderrama modification of the Patel and Teja Equation of State (VPT EoS) for fugacity calculations in fluid phases, while the hydrate phase is modeled using the solid solution theory of van der Waals and Platteeuw (1959), as implemented by Cole and Goodwin (1990). The Kihara model for spherical molecules is applied to calculate the potential function for hydrate-forming gases. To account for capillary pressure effects on phase fugacities, we apply a correction similar to the Poynting correction for saturated liquids. This correction can be applied to any model capable of predicting bulk (unconfined) hydrate phase equilibria. The only new parameter required is hydrate-liquid interfacial tension-values for which we have derived previously from experimental data. The model assumes cylindrical pores, although differs from the majority of existing literature models in how the curvature of the solid-liquid interface is considered; we assume a curvature of 2/r for growth and 1/r for dissociation, in accordance with accepted capillary theory. Model predictions are validated against previously published experimental hydrate dissociation data for binary CO2-H2O, CH4-H2O and ternary CH4-O-2-H2O systems, and newly reported data for CH4-H2O-CH4O (3.5 mass\% methanol aqueous solutions representing the salinity of seawater) systems, confined to mesoporous silica glass. Good agreement between predictions and experimental data is observed.},

With the elastic walls, the reciprocal influence of both fluid and solid (blood and artery) are taken into account, constituting a Fluid-Structure Interaction study. Furthermore, the study of the influence of mechanical properties of the artery, which become stiffer with the progression of atherosclerosis, on blood flow is also presented, an innovative approach relative to the work done in this field. Results show that the carotid sinus is the preferential zone to develop atherosclerosis, given its low values of Time-Averaged Wall Shear Stress. Additionally, it is fundamental to consider the arterial wall as elastic bodies, given that the rigid model overestimates the flow velocity and Wall Shear Stress. On the different mechanical properties of the vessel, its influence is minimal in the Time-Averaged Wall Shear Stress profiles.

  abstract = {The macroscopically emergent rheology of suspensions is dictated by details of fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions. For systems where the typical spatial scale on the particle level is much smaller than that of macroscopic properties, the scales can be split. We present a heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) approach to modeling suspension flow in which at the macroscale the suspension is treated as a non-Newtonian fluid. The local shear-rate and particle volume fraction are input to a simulation of fully resolved suspension microdynamics. With the help of these simulations, the apparent viscosity and shear-induced diffusivities can be computed for a given shear-rate and volume fraction, and are then used to complete the information needed in the constitutional relations on the macroscopic level. On both levels, the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is applied to model the fluid phase and coupled to a Lagrangian model for the advection-diffusion of the solid phase. Down and upward mapping of viscosity and diffusivity related quantities will be discussed, as well as information exchanged between the phases on both scales. Temporal scale splitting between viscous and diffusive dynamics has also been exploited to accelerate the macroscopic equilibration dynamics. Additionionally, Galileian and rotational symmetries allow us to make very efficient use of a database where the results of previous simulations can be stored, again reducing the computational effort by factors of several orders of magnitude. The HMM suspension model is applied to the simulation of a 2-dimensional flow through a straight channel of macroscopic width. The equilibration dynamics of flow and volume fraction profiles and equilibrium profiles of volume fraction, diffusivity, velocity, shear-rate, and viscosity are discussed. We show that the proposed HMM model not only reproduces experimental findings for low Reynolds numbers but also predicts additional dependencies introduced by shear-thickening effects not covered by existing macroscopic suspension flow models.},

Gas hydrate in the studied core samples was found by observation to have developed in sediment pores, and the distribution of hydrate saturation in the cores imply that gas hydrate had experienced stepwise dissociation before it was stabilized by either liquid nitrogen or pressurizing gas. The gas hydrates were determined to be structure Type I hydrate with hydration numbers of approximately 6.1 by instrumentation methods such as powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and solid state 13C NMR. The hydrate gas composition was predominantly methane, and isotopic analysis showed that the methane was of thermogenic origin (mean [delta]13C\dbend =\dbend -48.6[per mille sign] and [delta]D\dbend =\dbend -248[per mille sign] for sample HYLN7). Isotopic analysis of methane from sample HYPV4 revealed secondary hydrate formation from the pressurizing methane gas during storage.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe, low survival and rapidly progressive disease, characterised by an increase in the distal pulmonary vascular resistance and decrease in pulmonary compliance. The current standard procedure for PAH diagnosis and therapy response assessment is right heart catheterisation (RHC). Although if performed in a specialist centre, the severe complications associated with RHC are reduced, non-invasive alternatives are desirable. Windkessel models have been previously proposed[1], [2] to estimate the overall pulmonary system resistance and compliance.The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the pulmonary resistance and total vascular compliance computed using a Windkessel model can be used to assess the therapy response in PAH patients using MRI input data.56 treatment na\"ive patients, diagnosed with PAH at RHC, underwent MRI of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) at baseline and one year follow-up. A plug-in implemented in MATLAB was used to segment the MPA images at baseline and follow-up, extract the area and flow waveforms and compute the values of the Windkessel model.At follow-up, the computational results showed statistically significant increase of the compliance, CWk(p{$<$}0.05), and decrease in resistance, RWk (p{$<$}0.01). Separated according to the patient's sex, the femalesub-group showed a statistically significant increase of the compliance (p{$<$}0.01) and decrease of the resistance (p{$<$}0.01). However, the male sub-group showed statistically significant reduction of the resistance (p{$<$}0.05) but no significant increase of the model's compliance (p=0.19). When separated upon patient's age, younger patients (age{$\leq$}50 years) showed statistically significant decrease of the Windkessel resistance (p{$<$}0.01) and increase of the compliance (p{$<$}0.05), while older patients (age{$>$}50 years) showed statistically significant reduction of the resistance (p{$<$}0.01) but no significant increase of the Windkessel compliance (p=0.21).The non-invasive proposed metrics have the potential to assess the response to PAH therapy, reducing the RHC interventions at follow-up.},

The model aims at a proper description of the shear thinning behavior of blood at both low and high shear rates. While empirically based, it relies on continuum constitutive theories. The model has been verified by fitting the experimental data available in the literature using the weighted least squares. Results show that the proposed model fits the experimental data with nearly constant parameters in a wide shear range, and with average deviations {$\epsilon\bar$} less than 6.24\%. Formulae to calculate the velocity profile and flow rate of the proposed model in a straight tube flow were deduced. Compared to Casson's and Newtonian models, it is concluded that the proposed model is more effective in describing the shear thinning behavior of blood within a wide shear range.},

  abstract = {Atherosclerosis is influenced by blood flow whichS exert wall shear stress (WSS) on endothelial cells (EC). Low oscillatory WSS promotes atherosclerosis by inducing inflammatory molecules (e.g. VCAM-1), whereas high uniform WSS induces anti-inflammatory genes (e.g. eNOS). Ivabradine decreases heart rate by inhibiting the If current in the sinus node, without affecting blood pressure or cardiac contractility. Besides cardio-protection, ivabradine protects arteries from atherosclerosis via unknown mechanisms. We hypothesised that ivabradine reduces arterial inflammation by increasing blood flow-induced WSS. Mice (C57BL/6, male, aged 10 weeks) were treated with ivabradine for 1 week (162 mg/L in drinking water) or remained untreated. WSS was mapped at atherosusceptible (inner curvature) and protected (outer curvature) sites of the aorta by defining the geometry (CT angiography; Siemens) and flow characteristics (ultrasound; Visualsonics). Segmentation and smoothing were performed to reconstruct the volume of interest (Amira, VMTK) and a tetrahedral mesh with prismatic boundary layer was generated (IcemCFD). Fluid behavior was modeled over the cardiac cycle using Fluent 14.5 (ANSYS). Computational fluid dynamics revealed that WSS at the inner curvature of the aorta had lower magnitude and higher oscillatory index compared to the outer curvature. Ivabradine treatment reduced heart rate by 20\% (p{$<$}0.05; n=5 per group) and altered WSS at the inner curvature by increasing magnitude and reducing oscillatory index. En face immunostaining and confocal microscopy demonstrated that treatment with ivabradine led to reduced VCAM-1 expression (mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs): 710.6 (untreated) vs 4.4 (treated); p{$<$}0.01; n=5 per group) and enhanced eNOS expression (MFIs: 3.48 (untreated) and 6.25 (treated); p=0.05; n=5 per group) at the inner curvature. We conclude that ivabradine treatment altered hemodynamics in the murine aorta by increasing the magnitude and uniformity of shear stress. These changes were accompanied by induction of a mechanosensitive protective gene (eNOS) and suppression of inflammatory VCAM-1. Thus ivabradine may protect arteries by altering local mechanical conditions to trigger an anti-inflammatory response.},

The robustness and accuracy of the LBM\textendash FEA method is demonstrated by simulating an inflating thin-walled sphere, a deformable spherical capsule in shear flow, a settling sphere in a confined channel, two approaching spheres, spheres in shear flow, and red blood cell deformation in flow chambers. Additionally, simulations of suspensions of hundreds of biconcave red blood cells at 40\% volume fraction produce continuum-scale physics and accurately predict suspension viscosity and the shear-thinning behaviour of blood. Simulations of fluid-filled spherical capsules which have red-blood-cell membrane properties also display deformation-induced shear-thinning behaviour at 40\% volume fraction, although the suspension viscosity is significantly lower than blood.},

This is a common occurrence in gas hydrate-bearing marine sequences, and it has been related to the inhibition of hydrate formation in the small pores of fine-grained sediments. This paper applies a mass balance model to gas hydrate formation in a stack of alternating fine- and coarse-grained sediment layers. The only source of methane considered is in situ microbial conversion of a small amount of organic carbon ({$<$}0.5\% dry weight fraction). The results show that in a sequence such as that at Site 01325 the methane concentration never reaches the supersaturation needed to form gas hydrates in the fine-grained layers. Methane generated in these layers is transported by diffusion into the coarse-grained layers where it forms concentrated gas hydrate deposits. The vertical distribution and amount of gas hydrate observed at Site 01325 can be explained by in situ microbial methane generation, and a deep methane source is not necessary. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to determine whether in vivo bifurcation geometric factors would permit prediction of the risk of atherosclerosis. It is worldwide accepted that low or oscillatory wall shear stress (WSS) is a robust hemodynamic factor in the development of atherosclerotic plaque and has a strong correlation with the local site of plaque deposition. However, it still remains unclear how coronary bifurcation geometries are correlated with such hemodynamic forces. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed on left main (LM) coronary bifurcation geometries derived from CT of eight patients without significant atherosclerosis. WSS amplitudes were accurately quantified at two high risk zones of atherosclerosis, namely at proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and at proximal left circumflex artery (LCx), and also at three high WSS concentration sites near the bifurcation. Statistical analysis was used to highlight relationships between WSS amplitudes calculated at these five zones of interest and various geometric factors. The tortuosity index of the LM-LAD segment appears to be an emergent geometric factor in determining the low WSS amplitude at proximal LAD. Strong correlations were found between the high WSS amplitudes calculated at the endothelial regions close to the flow divider. This study not only demonstrated that CT imaging studies of local risk factor for atherosclerosis could be clinically performed, but also showed that tortuosity of LM-LAD coronary branch could be used as a surrogate marker for the onset of atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) benchmark nozzle model has been studied extensively both experimentally and computationally. Although considerable efforts have been made on validations of a variety of numerical models against available experimental data, the transitional flow cases are still not fully resolved, especially with regards to detailed comparison of predicted turbulence quantities with experimental measurements. This study aims to fill this gap by conducting large-eddy simulations (LES) of flow through the FDA's benchmark model, at a transitional Reynolds number of 2000. Numerical results are compared to previous interlaboratory experimental results, with an emphasis on turbulence characteristics. Our results show that the LES methodology can accurately capture laminar quantities throughout the model. In the pre-jet breakdown region, predicted turbulence quantities are generally larger than high resolution experimental data acquired with laser Doppler velocimetry. In the jet breakdown regions, where maximum Reynolds stresses occur, Reynolds shear stresses show excellent agreement. Differences of up to 4\% and 20\% are observed near the jet core in the axial and radial normal Reynolds stresses, respectively. Comparisons between viscous and Reynolds shear stresses show that peak viscous shear stresses occur in the nozzle throat reaching a value of 18 Pa in the boundary layer, whilst peak Reynolds shear stresses occur in the jet breakdown region reaching a maximum value of 87 Pa. Our results highlight the importance in considering both laminar and turbulent contributions towards shear stresses and that neglecting the turbulence effect can significantly underestimate the total shear force exerted on the fluid.},

  abstract = {Tandem cycling enables visually impaired athletes to compete in cycling in the Paralympics. Tandem aerodynamics can be analysed by track measurements, wind-tunnel experiments and numerical simulations with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). However, the proximity of the pilot (front) and the stoker (rear) and the associated strong aerodynamic interactions between both athletes present substantial challenges for CFD simulations, the results of which can be very sensitive to computational parameters such as grid topology and turbulence model. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first CFD and wind-tunnel investigation on tandem cycling aerodynamics. The study analyses the influence of the CFD grid topology and the turbulence model on the aerodynamic forces on pilot and stoker and compares the results with wind-tunnel measurements. It is shown that certain combinations of grid topology and turbulence model give trends that are opposite to those shown by other combinations. Indeed, some combinations provide counter-intuitive drag outcomes with the stoker experiencing a drag force up to 28\% greater than the pilot. Furthermore, the application of a blockage correction for two athlete bodies in close proximity is investigated. Based on a large number of CFD simulations and validation with wind-tunnel measurements, this paper provides guidelines for the accurate CFD simulation of tandem aerodynamics.},

  abstract = {Red blood cell (RBC) migration effects and RBC-plasma interactions occurring in microvessel blood flow have been investigated numerically using a shear-induced particle migration model. The mathematical model is based on the momentum and continuity equations for the suspension flow and a constitutive equation accounting for the effects of shear-induced RBC migration in concentrated suspensions. The model couples a non-Newtonian stress/shear rate relationship with a shear-induced migration model of the suspended particles in which the viscosity is dependent on the haematocrit and the shear rate (Quemada model). The focus of this paper is on the determination of the two phenomenological parameters, Kc and Kmu, in a diffusive flux model when using the non-Newtonian Quemada model and assuming deformable particles. Previous use of the diffusive flux model has assumed constant values for the diffusion coefficients which serve as tuning parameters in the phenomenological equation. Here, previous data [Biophys. J. 92 (2007), 1858-1877; J. Fluid Mech. 557 (2006), 297-306] is used to develop a new model in which the diffusion coefficients depend upon the tube haematocrit and the dimensionless vessel radius for initially uniform suspensions. This model is validated through previous publications and close agreement is obtained.},

In addition, the intrinsic sensitivity of MRI to motion offers the unique ability to acquire spatially registered blood flow simultaneously with the morphological data, within a single measurement. In clinical routine, flow MRI is typically accomplished using methods that resolve two spatial dimensions in individual planes and encode the time-resolved velocity in one principal direction, typically oriented perpendicular to the two-dimensional (2D) section. This review describes recently developed advanced MRI flow techniques, which allow for more comprehensive evaluation of blood flow characteristics, such as real-time flow imaging, 2D multiple-venc phase contrast MRI, four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI, quantification of complex haemodynamic properties, and highly accelerated flow imaging. Emerging techniques and novel applications are explored. In addition, applications of these new techniques for the improved evaluation of cardiovascular (aorta, pulmonary arteries, congenital heart disease, atrial fibrillation, coronary arteries) as well as cerebrovascular disease (intra-cranial arteries and veins) are presented.},

  abstract = {Background Intraventricular fluid dynamics can be assessed clinically using imaging. The contribution of vortex structures to left ventricular (LV) diastolic function has never been quantified in vivo. Conclusions The diastolic vortex is responsible for entering a significant fraction of LV filling volume at no energetic or pressure cost. Thus, intraventricular fluid mechanics are an important determinant of global chamber LV operative stiffness. Reduced stiffness in NIDCM is partially related to enhanced vorticity. Conversely, impaired vortex generation is an unreported mechanism of diastolic dysfunction in HCM and probably other causes of concentric remodeling. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;64:171121). Results The vortex was responsible for entering 13 ?? 6\% of filling volume in the control group and 19 ??8\% in the NIDCM group (p = 0.004), but only 5 ?? 5\% in the HCM group (p {$<$}0.0001 vs. controls). Favorable vortical effects on intraventricular pressure gradients were observed in the control and NIDCM groups but not in HCM patients. Differences in chamber sphericity explained variations in the vortex contribution to filling between groups (p {$<$}0.005). Objectives This study sought to understand the impact of intraventricular flow patterns on filling and to assess whether impaired fluid dynamics may be a source of diastolic dysfunction. Methods Two-dimensional flow velocity fields from color Doppler echocardiographic sequences were obtained in 20 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM), 20 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and 20 control healthy volunteers. Using a flow decomposition method, we isolated the rotational velocity generated by the vortex ring from the surrounding flow in the left ventricle.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that the release of clathrates rather than expansion of wetlands is the primary cause of the rapid increases observed in the ice-core atmospheric methane record during the Pleistocene. Because submarine sediment failures can involve as much as 5000 Gt of sediment and have the capacity to release vast quantities of methane hydrates, one of the major tests of the clathrate gun hypothesis is determining whether the periods of enhanced continental-slope failure and atmospheric methane correlate. To test the clathrate gun hypothesis, we have collated published dates for submarine sediment failures in the North Atlantic sector and correlated them with climatic change for the past 45 k.y. More than 70\% by volume of continental-slope failures during the past 45 k.y. was displaced in two periods, between 15 and 13 ka and between 11 and 8 ka. Both these intervals correlate with rising sea level and peaks in the methane record during the B\o{} lling-\textbackslash AA ller\o{} d and Preboreal periods. These data support the clathrate gun hypothesis for glacial-interglacial transitions. The data do not, however, support the clathrate gun hypothesis for glacial millennial-scale climate cycles, because the occurrence of sediment failures correlates with Heinrich events, i.e., lows in sea level and atmospheric methane. A secondary use of this data set is the insight into the possible cause of continental-slope failures. Glacial-period slope failures occur mainly in the low latitudes and are associated with lowering sea level. This finding suggests that reduced hydrostatic pressure and the associated destabilization of gas hydrates may be the primary cause. The B\o{} lling-\textbackslash AA ller\o{} d sediment failures were predominantly low latitude, suggesting an early tropical response to deglaciation, e.g., enhanced precipitation and sediment load to the continental shelf or warming of intermediate waters. In contrast, sediment failures during the Preboreal period and the majority of the Holocene occurred in the high latitudes, suggesting either isostatic rebound\textendash related earthquake activity or reduced hydrostatic pressure caused by isostatic rebound, causing destabilization of gas hydrates.},

These concerns have increased the interest in developing second generation biofuels produced from non-food feedstocks such as microalgae, which potentially offer greatest opportunities in the longer term. This paper reviews the current status of microalgae use for biodiesel production, including their cultivation, harvesting, and processing. The microalgae species most used for biodiesel production are presented and their main advantages described in comparison with other available biodiesel feedstocks. The various aspects associated with the design of microalgae production units are described, giving an overview of the current state of development of algae cultivation systems (photo-bioreactors and open ponds). Other potential applications and products from microalgae are also presented such as for biological sequestration of CO2, wastewater treatment, in human health, as food additive, and for aquaculture.},

  abstract = {Chapter 1 discusses hydrate as part of a spectrum of naturally occurring hydrocarbon resources. Specifically, different sources of conventional and unconventional gas deposits are discussed including coalbed methane, which may provide the most relevant commercial development model for bringing an unconventional gas resource into production and profitability. Because the energy needs and national economic and political parameters governing decision-making may vary considerably, the impetus driving development of hydrate is urgently felt in some countries while it is ignored in others. Superdemand for energy worldwide has also lifted hydrocarbon prices to a new plateau. Energy prices are likely to be maintained substantially above the levels of the inexpensive world energy paradigm that previously had been controlled by the United States. Chapter 2 focuses on those elements of gas hydrate nucleation and growth that are important to the formation of hydrate concentrations. Growth media, including both gaseous and aqueous environments, are discussed, along with the natural mechanisms that are likely to yield high pore saturations through heterogeneous nucleation and slow growth as a result of naturally modulated supply of hydrate-forming reactants. The principals of both dissociation and dissolution are also described because these are important for recovery of natural gas from hydrate. Physical chemistry is used to illustrate growth models that have been tested through experimentation, and are constrained by thermodynamics, to produce solid hydrate. This section contains enough physical chemical information to allow a geologist or economic geologist who is not a specialist in physical chemistry and hydrate paragenesis to better understand the hydrate system and environmental constraints that may lead to the formation and recovery of natural gas from economic deposits of hydrate. Chapter 3 characterizes hydrate as part of the geological environment. Gas hydrates comprise an unconventional diagenetic hydrocarbon mineral-like deposit that may be associated with conventional deposits of natural gas. One of the present difficulties hampering many petroleum geologists and geophysicists is that hydrate, and especially concentrations of hydrate, are not governed by the same rules as are conventional hydrocarbon deposits. Gas hydrate is unique among hydrocarbon resources in that it is a solid crystalline material in the natural state, which can rapidly transform to its constituent water and gas in response to changing pressure and temperature. Porous sediments containing high concentrations of hydrate have been investigated through drilling in the Mackenzie Delta of Canada and in the deep continental shelf margin offshore Japan. Data derived from drilling is now providing the ground truth needed for realistic assessment of hydrate grades and values. Chapter 4 summarizes known hydrate localities in both permafrost and oceanic areas from the point of view of their modes of formation. Clear distinctions between them are described, as are the similarities and distinctions between them and conventional gas deposits and the means available for recovery of the natural gas from hydrate deposits. Hydrate is identified as an economic mineral deposit and compared with other solid, crystalline stratabound mineral deposits of diagenetic origin, with which there are many similarities. A great deal is understood about both metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits with similar paragenesis. Application of that knowledge should aid in the identification of geological settings most appropriate for hosting significant concentrations of hydrate economic targets or 'sweetspots', so as to guide exploration. Chapter 5. Natural gas derived from hydrate may be inherently more expensive to recover than most conventional gas deposits because the equivalent of secondary recovery methods must be applied from the beginning. Whereas conventional gas and petroleum deposits are artesian or only have to be pumped to the surface, the hydrate must first be converted to gas. The three main methods for converting the hydrate to recoverable gas (Depressurization, inhibitor stimulation, and thermal stimulation) require different infrastructure and materials and consequent costs. It is also likely that more than one method may be used together in some way, for instance, heating and depressurization. Existing exploration and assessments of hydrate developments are described. Nonetheless, because of the higher energy cost levels that are likely to persist, and because better economic cost and extraction models for hydrate are being developed, extracting natural gas from hydrate may become an attractive investment. Chapter 6 takes forward the current knowledge of hydrate formation and models likely economic deposits of oceanic gas hydrate. Oceanic hydrate deposits are diagenetic and have grown in place in the sediment by incorporating pore water, under pressure and temperature conditions similar to those in which they now exist. Identification of BSR (3.3.2), is a first order technique for identifying the phase boundary between the hydrate stability zone and underlying gas (Chapters 3 and 5), but more refined techniques are required to identify economic deposits of hydrate. The different models for economic deposits of hydrate are assessed for their response to seismic and other exploration methods and some guidance is offered. Permafrost hydrate deposits appear to be fundamentally different from oceanic hydrate deposits. For the most part, they have been formed from existing conventional gas deposits that were converted to hydrate through the depression of the cryosphere across at least part of the gas zone during intensification of glacial periods, rather than being formed through the migration of hydrate-forming gas into the GHSZ. Hydrate will not be mined, of course. It will be converted to its constituent natural gas and recovered as gas. But extraction models in some deposits in weaker geological strata may do well to follow mining practices for extraction where some of the ore is left behind in order to promote reservoir stabilization and prevent collapse. This chapter focuses on applying different hydrate nucleation and growth models from Chapter 2 in different natural groundwater systems and geological situations. Chapter 7 presents one of the most recent thermodynamic models for In-Situ Conversion of Gas Hydrate to Natural Gas that is particularly applicable for high-grade oceanic hydrate deposits, which will probably be the initial source of natural gas from oceanic hydrate. Physical cases of hydrate occurrence that are likely to be encountered in potential economic deposits of gas hydrate are analyzed and shown to have significant economic potential for safely converting and extracting natural gas from hydrate. Chapter 8 considers the offshore regulatory and permitting environment for gas hydrate, which is governed by UNCLOS, the Law of the Sea. The articles that pertain to the geographic position of likely hydrate deposits along continental margin, as well as examples for particular countries, are explained in detail. National exploration and extraction resource legislation is only briefly discussed. Existing and potential claims for areas beyond the present limit of 200 nmi are not discussed, because the framework for resolution of those claims and for competing claims to continental shelf areas claimed by more than one nation exist in the present UNCLOS documents and procedures. Chapter 9 summarizes the main characteristics for both permafrost and oceanic natural gas hydrate and the timeliness of the recognition of natural gas hydrate as the likely next big gas play. Emphasis is placed upon the sufficiency of the present level of technology in deep water drilling and hydrocarbon exploration, extraction, and infrastructure for recovering natural gas from oceanic and permafrost hydrate deposits.

  abstract = {A marked interest has recently emerged regarding the analysis of the wall shear stress (WSS) vector field topological skeleton in cardiovascular flows. Based on dynamical system theory, the WSS topological skeleton is composed of fixed points, i.e., focal points where WSS locally vanishes, and unstable/stable manifolds, consisting of contraction/expansion regions linking fixed points. Such an interest arises from its ability to reflect the presence of near-wall hemodynamic features associated with the onset and progression of vascular diseases. Over the years, Lagrangian-based and Eulerian-based post-processing techniques have been proposed aiming at identifying the topological skeleton features of the WSS. Here, the theoretical and methodological bases supporting the Lagrangian- and Eulerian-based methods currently used in the literature are reported and discussed, highlighting their application to cardiovascular flows. The final aim is to promote the use of WSS topological skeleton analysis in hemodynamic applications and to encourage its application in future mechanobiology studies in order to increase the chance of elucidating the mechanistic links between blood flow disturbances, vascular disease, and clinical observations.},

During LV unloading ``runs,'' the LVAD flow (QV) increased (up to 5.8 +/- 0.71 liters/min), although there were decreases in SW (3,061 +/- 747 to 1,556 +/- 410 mm Hg ml-1), LV TP (3,127 +/- 397 to 1,019 +/- 335 x 105) and LV EDP (18.2 +/- 1.2 to 9.7 +/- 1.8 mm Hg). The TP/EDP and SW/EDV relationships established during the unloading runs were highly linear (R2 up to 0.95) and their slopes were reduced by [beta]-adrenergic blockade (p {$<$} 0.001).Conclusions The TP/EDP relationship established during LVAD unloading of the LV was load-independent and sensitive to changes in cardiac inotropy, and correlated with PRSW.}

  abstract = {An unsteady computational fluid dynamic methodology was developed so that design analyses could be undertaken for devices such as the 50cc Penn State positive-displacement left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The piston motion observed in vitro was modeled, yielding the physiologic flow waveform observed during pulsatile experiments. Valve closure was modeled numerically by locally increasing fluid viscosity during the closed phase. Computational geometry contained Bjork-Shiley Monostrut mechanical heart valves in mitral and aortic positions. Cases for computational analysis included LVAD operation under steady-flow and pulsatile-flow conditions. Computations were validated by comparing simulation results with previously obtained in vitro particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The steady portion of the analysis studied effects of mitral valve orientation, comparing the computational results with in vitro data obtained from mock circulatory loop experiments. The velocity field showed good qualitative agreement with the in vitro PIV data. The pulsatile flow simulations modeled the unsteady flow phenomena associated with a positive-displacement LVAD operating through several beat cycles. Flow velocity gradients allowed computation of the scalar wall strain rate, an important factor for determining hemodynamics of the device. Velocity magnitude contours compared well with PIV data throughout the cycle. Computational wall shear rates over the pulsatile cycle were found to be in the same range as wall shear rates observed in vitro.}

  abstract = {The initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, which is the main cause of cardiovascular diseases, correlate with local haemodynamic factors such as wall shear stress (WSS). Numerical simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on medical imaging have been employed to analyse blood flow in different arteries with and without luminal stenosis. Patient-specific CFD models, however, have assumptions on blood rheology. The differences in the calculated haemodynamic factors between different rheological models have not been fully evaluated. In this study, carotid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on six patients with different degrees of carotid stenosis and two healthy volunteers. Using the 3D reconstructed carotid geometries and the patient-specific boundary conditions, CFD simulations were performed by applying a Newtonian and four non-Newtonian models (Carreau, Cross, Quemada and Power-law). WSS descriptors and pressure gradient were analysed and compared between the models. The differences in the maximum and the average oscillatory shear index between the Newtonian and the non-Newtonian models were lower than 12.7\% and 12\%, respectively. The differences in pressure gradient were also within 15\%. The differences in the mean time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) between the Newtonian and Cross, Carreau and Power-law models were lower than 6\%. In contrast, a higher difference (26\%) was found in Quemada. For the low TAWSS, the differences from the Newtonian to the non-Newtonian models were much larger, in the range of 0.4\textendash 31\% for Carreau, 3\textendash 22\% for Cross, 5\textendash 51\% for Quemada and 10\textendash 41\% for Power-law. The study suggests that the assumption of a Newtonian model is reasonable when the overall flow pattern or the mean values of the WSS descriptors are investigated. However, the non-Newtonian model is necessary when the low TAWSS region is the focus, especially for arteries with severe stenosis.},

The yield stress is essentially independent of temperature and its cube root varies linearly with hematocrit value. The dynamic rheological properties in the creeping flow range are such that the relative viscosity of blood to water is almost independent of temperature.

  abstract = {The Poisson and Laplace equations arise in many engineering applications, such as the potential theory of hydrodynamics and electromagnetism. Also, in solving problems in incompressible flow, the pressure equation (Poisson equation) needs to be solved in updating the Navier\textendash Stokes solver. In solid mechanics, the Poisson equation arises in the analysis of small transverse deflections of a tensed membrane subjected to a transverse load. If the membrane is replaced by a linearly elastic plate with bending stiffness, the transverse deflections must obey the inhomogeneous biharmonic equation. The biharmonic equation arises also in the analysis of two-dimensional elasticity problems formulated in terms of the Airy stress function. In the following sections, the solution of the above-mentioned equations by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) will be undertaken, and the results will be compared with available analytic solutions or with conventional numerical methods predictions.},

In the continuous approach, ordinary or partial differential equations can be obtained by applying conservation of energy, mass, and momentum with an infinitesimal control volume. Since it is difficult to solve the governing differential equations for many reasons (nonlinearity, complex boundary conditions, complex geometry, etc.), one uses finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods, among others, to convert the governing differential equations with a given boundary and initial conditions to a system of algebraic equations.

  abstract = {The non-uniform distribution of atherosclerosis within the arterial system has been attributed to pro-atherogenic influences of low, oscillatory haemodynamic wall shear stress (WSS) on endothelial cells (EC). This theory is challenged by the changes in lesion location that occur with age in human and rabbit aortas. Furthermore, a number of point-wise comparisons of lesion prevalence and WSS have failed to support it. Here we investigate the hypothesis that multidirectional flow-characterized as the average magnitude of WSS components acting transversely to the mean vector (transWSS)-plays a key role. Maps of lesion prevalence around aortic branch ostia in immature and mature rabbits were compared with equivalent maps of time average WSS, the OSI (an index characterizing oscillatory flow) and transWSS, obtained from computational simulations; Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated for aggregated data and 95\% confidence intervals were obtained by bootstrapping methods. Lesion prevalence correlated positively, strongly and significantly with transWSS at both ages. Correlations of lesion prevalence with the other shear metrics were not significant or were significantly lower than those obtained for transWSS. No correlation supported the low, oscillatory WSS theory. The data are consistent with the view that multidirectional near-wall flow is highly pro-atherogenic. Effects of multidirectional flow on EC, and methods for investigating them, are reviewed. The finding that oscillatory flow has pro-inflammatory effects when acting perpendicularly to the long axis of EC but anti-inflammatory effects when acting parallel to it may explain the stronger correlation of lesion prevalence with transWSS than with the OSI.},

  abstract = {The patchy distribution of atherosclerosis within arteries is widely attributed to local variation in haemodynamic wall shear stress (WSS). A recently-introduced metric, the transverse wall shear stress (transWSS), which is the average over the cardiac cycle of WSS components perpendicular to the temporal mean WSS vector, correlates particularly well with the pattern of lesions around aortic branch ostia. Here we use numerical methods to investigate the nature of the arterial flows captured by transWSS and the sensitivity of transWSS to inflow waveform and aortic geometry. TransWSS developed chiefly in the acceleration, peak systolic and deceleration phases of the cardiac cycle; the reverse flow phase was too short, and WSS in diastole was too low, for these periods to have a significant influence. Most of the spatial variation in transWSS arose from variation in the angle by which instantaneous WSS vectors deviated from the mean WSS vector rather than from variation in the magnitude of the vectors. The pattern of transWSS was insensitive to inflow waveform; only unphysiologically high Womersley numbers produced substantial changes. However, transWSS was sensitive to changes in geometry. The curvature of the arch and proximal descending aorta were responsible for the principal features, the non-planar nature of the aorta produced asymmetries in the location and position of streaks of high transWSS, and taper determined the persistence of the streaks down the aorta. These results reflect the importance of the fluctuating strength of Dean vortices in generating transWSS.},

  abstract = {Mechanical stresses on aortic valve leaflets are well-known mediators for initiating processes leading to calcific aortic valve disease. Given that non-coronary leaflets calcify first, it may be hypothesized that coronary flow originating from the ostia significantly influences aortic leaflet mechanics and sinus hemodynamics. High resolution time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were conducted to map the spatiotemporal characteristics of aortic sinus blood flow and leaflet motion with and without physiological coronary flow in a well-controlled in vitro setup. The in vitro setup consists of a porcine aortic valve mounted in a physiological aorta sinus chamber with dynamically controlled coronary resistance to emulate physiological coronary flow. Results were analyzed using qualitative streak plots illustrating the spatiotemporal complexity of blood flow patterns, and quantitative velocity vector and shear stress contour plots to show differences in the mechanical environments between the coronary and non-coronary sinuses. It is shown that the presence of coronary flow pulls the classical sinus vorticity deeper into the sinus and increases flow velocity near the leaflet base. This creates a beneficial increase in shear stress and washout near the leaflet that is not seen in the non-coronary sinus. Further, leaflet opens approximately 10\% farther into the sinus with coronary flow case indicating superior valve opening area. The presence of coronary flow significantly improves leaflet mechanics and sinus hemodynamics in a manner that would reduce low wall shear stress conditions while improving washout at the base of the leaflet.},

  abstract = {The distribution of Low density lipoprotein (LDL) within the arterial wall is helpful in understanding the onset and development of atherosclerosis. The objective of the study is to study the transport and LDL distribution within patient-specific arterial wall using computational analysis under normal and hypertensive conditions. Patient specific model of the thoracic aorta is computationally examined. The arterial wall is treated macroscopically as homogeneous (one layered) porous media of variable thickness. The interfacial lumen-arterial wall (endothelium) coupling is achieved by the Kedem-Katchalsky equation. High values of LDL are located at areas where WSS values range from 0.4~N/m to 1.5~N/m for normal conditions. In this case the Pearson correlation coefficient r between LDL values and WSS is equal to -0.655 denoting a strong negative linear correlation. In the case that hypertension takes place, high LDL values are located at areas where WSS values range from 0.59~N/m to 1.7~N/m and the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient r is equal to -0.808 denoting a very strong negative linear correlation. For the same parabolic intake flow velocity profile, the luminal surface concentration of LDL is 0.2-2.1\% higher than that of the bulk flow for the normal pressure and 0.4-3.4\% higher than that of the bulk flow for the hypertensive pressure. For normal conditions, the concentration of LDL at the endothelium/media interface is considerably lower (almost 20 times) than the LDL concentration value at lumen/endothelium interface. For hypertensive conditions, the LDL concentration at the endothelium/media interface is only 4.5 times lower than the corresponding luminal (endothelium side) concentration. The lumen/endothelium side locations (mainly the concave parts) of low WSS - high LDL concentration values coincide with those of high wall-side LDL concentration. The transport and LDL distribution is affected by elevated transmural pressure which causes higher LDL concentration. Thus, hypertensive conditions theoretically enhance atherosclerosis.},

In this study, we apply a novel echocardiographic flow-mapping technique, vector flow mapping (VFM), to evaluate the main characteristics of left ventricular vortices and its relation to filling parameters. METHODS: Forty-eight subjects underwent conventional transthoracic echocardiographic examination with additional intracardiac flow assessment with VFM using a Aloka Alpha-10 system and experimental VFM analysis software. To analyze vortex behavior, its rotation direction, duration, location inside the left ventricle, size, and intensity were assessed in apical long-axis view. Its relation to conventional left ventricular filling parameters was then analyzed. RESULTS: Two vortex components were consistently identified following each transmitral filling wave. The anterior component of these visualized vortices was analyzed, due to its higher significance in the cardiac cycle, following early filling (V1) and atrial contraction (V2). Differences were observed in several aspects of vortex behavior between V1 and V2, particularly in patients with normal left ventricular filling parameters. These differences may be related to varying roles of vortices in different periods of the cardiac cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Vector flow mapping allowed visualization and measurement of several parameters defining vortex behavior inside the cardiac cycle. The differences observed in these parameters between vortices in different phases of the cardiac cycle may be related to their role in optimizing cardiac function.},

The currently available pulsatile devices are solely dependent of preload volume and, when placed in the automatic mode, can maintain physiologic cardiac outputs with exercise. However, because of their dependence on preload volume, there are unique physiologic consequences; device bradycardia represents volume depletion, device tachycardia reflects volume overload. The differential diagnosis of left ventricular assist device dysfunction includes native right ventricular failure, native left ventricular recovery, or other technical considerations. The management of biventricular mechanical support as well as arrhythmia management and the role of echocardiographic assessment in this unique patient population will be discussed. Expertise in outpatient management of such devices is now a requisite for subspecialists in heart failure, In the future, technical innovations may simplify management for professionals, patients, and their families.}

We present a simple valve model that predicts valve motion on the basis of this pressure difference, and can be used to investigate not only valve pathology, but a wide range of cardiac and vascular factors that are likely to influence valve motion.

  abstract = {Gas production was predicted from a reservoir model based on the Mount Elbert gas hydrate accumulation located on the Alaska North slope at various simulator submodels and production scenarios. Log, core, and fluid measurements were used to provide a comprehensive reservoir description. These data were incorporated with experimentally derived saturations, porosities, permeability values, parameters for capillary pressure, and relative permeability functions. The modeled reservoir exposed to depressurization at a constant bottomhole pressure (2.7 MPa) has shown limited production potential due to its low temperature profile. To improve production the bottomhole pressure was allowed to vary from 2.7 (above the quadruple point) to 2.0 MPa over a 15-year period. The results indicate that gas production was nearly doubled in comparison with a constant-pressure regime. Extensive ice formation and hydrate reformation that could severely hinder gas production were avoided in the variable-pressure regime system. A use of permeability variation coupled with porosity change is shown to be crucial to predict those phenomena at a reservoir scale.},

Our results support the general belief that adding NaI to Newtonian fluids matches the RI without changing the kinematic viscosity. However, in contrast to claims made in a few studies that did not measure rheology, our investigation revealed that adding NaI or NaSCN to XG-based non-Newtonian fluids changes the viscosity of the fluids considerably and reduces the shear-thinning property. Therefore, the RI of non-Newtonian blood-analog fluids with XG cannot be adjusted easily by varying the concentration of NaI or NaSCN and needs more careful rheological~study.},

This model balances the wall-induced hydrodynamic lift on deformable particles with the flux due to binary collisions, which we represent via a second-order kinetic master equation. Our theory predicts a depletion of particles near the channel wall (i.e., the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect), followed by a near-wall formation of particle layers. We quantify the effect of channel height, viscosity ratio, and shear-rate on the cell-free layer thickness (i.e., the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect). The results agree with in vitro experiments as well as boundary integral simulations of suspension flows. Lastly, we examine a new type of collective particle motion for red blood cells induced by hydrodynamic interactions near the wall. These ``swapping trajectories,'' coined by Zurita-Gotor et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 592, 447\textendash 469 (2007)10.1017/S0022112007008701], could explain the origin of particle layering near the wall. The theory we describe represents a significant improvement in terms of time savings and predictive power over current large-scale numerical simulations of suspension flows.},

In accord with experimental studies on the rheological behavior of blood, three blood constitutive equations namely the Casson, Power-Law and Quemada models were used for simulating the shear flow behavior of blood. The case studied is the flow in a channel with a moving part of the boundary and was selected because it reproduces the flow phenomena occurring in realistic arterial conditions. Flow simulation for every model is carried out assuming the same flow rate at the inlet of the channel and different Strouhal numbers reflecting different intensities of the boundary movement. Results show that the modeling of blood as non-Newtonian fluid has marked qualitative and quantitative effects on both the flow field and the wall shear stress whereas comparison of the different models shows good agreement between the flow effects by the Casson and Quemada models.}

These types of blood flow visualization can be of great asset to the medical field helping medical practitioners better predict the existence of any abnormalities in the patient, hence offer an appropriate treatment. The methodology employed in this work processed geometries obtained from MRI scans of patient-specific LV throughout a cardiac cycle using computer-aided design tool. It then used unstructured mesh generation techniques to generate surface and volume meshes for flow simulations; thus provided flow visualization and characteristics in patient-specific LV. The resulting CFD model provides three dimensional velocity streamlines on the geometries at specific times in a cardiac cycle, and they are compared with existing literature findings, such as data from echocardiography particle image velocimetry. As an important flow characteristic, vortex formation of the blood flow of healthy as well as diseased subjects having a LV dysfunction condition are also obtained from simulations and further investigated for potential diagnosis. The current work established a pipeline for a non-invasive diagnostic tool for diastolic dysfunction by generating patient-specific LV models and CFD models in the spatiotemporal dimensions. The proposed framework was applied for analysis of a group of normal subjects and patients with cardiac diseases. Results obtained using the numerical tool showed distinct differences in flow characteristics in the LV between patient with diastolic dysfunction and healthy subjects. In particular, vortex structures do not develop during cardiac cycles for patients while it was clearly seen in the normal subjects. The current LV CFD model has proven to be a promising technology to aid in the diagnosis of LV conditions leading to heart failures.},

Using a transient, one-dimensional, two-phase ( gas hydrate and fluid) numerical model based on a coupled conservation approach, we examine permeability clogging during gas hydrate formation in end-member porous media and fractures initially lacking hydrate and determine the resulting changes in fluid and advective energy flux. Gas hydrate accumulates most rapidly at depth in both systems, a result consistent with borehole logging and seismic studies on the Blake Ridge. Consideration of the ratio of surface area to fluid volume explains model results that imply more rapid permeability reduction in the porous media system and more uniform hydrate formation as a function of depth in the fracture system. Depending on fluid flux, fracture aperture, or pore sizes, and other factors, the timescale for permeability clogging due to the accumulation of gas hydrate ranges from thousands to millions of years. Regenerating gas hydrate to a concentration of 10-15\% of pore space in marine settings with fluid fluxes characteristic of Hydrate Ridge or Blake Ridge requires 10(3)-10(5) years, meaning that hydrate deposits in these settings cannot be viewed as a naturally renewable resource. These results also imply that significant time is required to reestablish gas hydrate deposits after large-scale dissociation events associated with global-scale climate change.},

Because arterial walls are biologically heterogeneous, the standard deviation of Young's modulus (YM-std) of the large arteries may better predict coronary atherosclerosis. However, the role of YM-std in the occurrence of coronary events has not been addressed so far. Therefore, this study investigated whether the carotid YM-std and the presence or absence of plaque improved CHD risk prediction. Methods One hundred and three patients with CHD (age 66 {$\pm$} 11 years) and 107 patients at high risk of atherosclerosis (age 61 {$\pm$} 7 years) were recruited. Carotid YM was measured by the vessel texture matching method, and YM-std was calculated. Carotid intima-media thickness was measured by the MyLab 90 ultrasound Platform employed dedicated software RF-tracking technology. Results In logistic regression analysis, YM-std (OR = 1{$\cdot$}010; 95\% CI = 1{$\cdot$}003\textendash 1{$\cdot$}016), carotid plaque (OR = 16{$\cdot$}759; 95\% CI = 3{$\cdot$}719\textendash 75{$\cdot$}533) and YM-std plus plaque (OR = 0{$\cdot$}989; 95\% CI = 0{$\cdot$}981\textendash 0{$\cdot$}997) were independent predictors of CHD. The traditional risk factors (TRF) plus YM-std plus plaque model showed a significant improvement in area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), which increased from 0{$\cdot$}717 (TRF only) to 0{$\cdot$}777 (95\% CI for the difference in adjusted AUC: 0{$\cdot$}010\textendash 0{$\cdot$}110). Conclusions Carotid YM-std is a powerful independent predictor of CHD. Adding plaque and YM-std to TRF improves CHD risk prediction.},

The computational model was constructed to realistically reproduce the boundary condition (72 beats per minute (bpm), cardiac output 4.5l/min) and the geometry of the experimental setup, including the valve housing and the hinge configuration. The simulation was carried out coupling a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package based on finite-volume method with user-defined code for solving the structural domain, and exploiting the parallel performance of the whole numerical setup. Outputs are leaflets excursion from opening to closure and the fluid dynamics through the valve. Results put in evidence a favorable comparison between the computed and the experimental data: the model captures the main features of the leaflet motion during the systole. The use of parallel computing drastically limited the computational costs, showing a linear scaling on 16 processors (despite the massive use of user-defined subroutines to manage the FSI process). The favorable agreement obtained between in vitro and in silico results of the leaflet displacements confirms the consistency of the numerical method used, and candidates the application of FSI models to become a major tool to optimize the MHV design and eventually provides useful information to surgeons.},

  abstract = {Dynamic simulations of the pressure-driven flow in a channel of a non-Brownian suspension at zero Reynolds number were conducted using Stokesian Dynamics. The simulations are for a monolayer of identical particles as a function of the dimensionless channel width and the bulk particle concentration. Starting from a homogeneous dispersion, the particles gradually migrate towards the centre of the channel, resulting in an homogeneous concentration profile and a blunting of the particle velocity profile. The time for achieving steady state scales as (H/a)3a/{$\langle$}u{$\rangle$}, where H is the channel width, a the radii of the particles, and {$\langle$}u{$\rangle$} the average suspension velocity in the channel. The concentration and velocity profiles determined from the simulations are in qualitative agreement with experiment.A model for suspension flow has been proposed in which macroscopic mass, momentum and energy balances are constructed and solved simultaneously. It is shown that the requirement that the suspension pressure be constant in directions perpendicular to the mean motion leads to particle migration and concentration variations in inhomogeneous flow. The concept of the suspension `temperature' \textendash{} a measure of the particle velocity fluctuations \textendash{} is introduced in order to provide a nonlocal description of suspension behaviour. The results of this model for channel flow are in good agreement with the simulations.},

Though this has been known for decades, colormaps with many colors across the visual spectra are often used to represent data, leading to the potential for misinterpretation or difficulty with interpretation by someone with this deficiency. Until the creation of the module presented here, there were no colormaps mathematically optimized for CVD using modern color appearance models. While there have been some attempts to make aesthetically pleasing or subjectively tolerable colormaps for those with CVD, our goal was to make optimized colormaps for the most accurate perception of scientific data by as many viewers as possible. We developed a Python module, cmaputil, to create CVD-optimized colormaps, which imports colormaps and modifies them to be perceptually uniform in CVD-safe colorspace while linearizing and maximizing the brightness range. The module is made available to the science community to enable others to easily create their own CVD-optimized colormaps. Here, we present an example CVD-optimized colormap created with this module that is optimized for viewing by those without a CVD as well as those with red-green colorblindness. This colormap, cividis, enables nearly-identical visual-data interpretation to both groups, is perceptually uniform in hue and brightness, and increases in brightness linearly.},

Although hemodynamics research has a long history, the field continues to expand due to recent advancements in numerical and experimental techniques at the micro-and nano-scales. In this paper, we review recent computational and experimental studies of blood flow in microcirculation and microfluidics. We first focus on the computational studies of red blood cell (RBC) dynamics, from the single cellular level to mesoscopic multiple cellular flows, followed by a review of recent computational adhesion models for white blood cells, platelets, and malaria-infected RBCs, in which the cell adhesion to the vascular wall is essential for cellular function. Recent developments in optical microscopy have enabled the observation of flowing blood cells in microfluidics. Experimental particle image velocimetry and particle tracking velocimetry techniques are described in this article. Advancements in micro total analysis system technologies have facilitated flowing cell separation with microfluidic devices, which can be used for biomedical applications, such as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer or large intestinal tumors. In this paper, cell-separation techniques are reviewed for microfluidic devices, emphasizing recent advances and the potential of this fast-evolving research field in the near future.},

Obstructive and sclerotic disorders within the carotid artery impact local blood flow patterns as well as overall impedance and blood supply to the brain. A lumped parameter model and an experimental in-vitro flow loop were used to study the effects of local stenosis and stiffness in the carotid artery based on a family of phantoms with different degrees of stenosis and compliance. The model also allows independent examination of the effects of downstream resistance and compliance. Mild to moderate stenosis was found to lead to minimal ({$\sim$}1\%) reduction in blood supply to the brain. Reduction in mean internal carotid artery (ICA) flow was statistically significant (p{$<$} 0.01) only above 70\% stenosis. On the other hand, a three-fold increase in stiffness of the carotid artery, as might occur in aging, was found to lead to a modest yet statistically significant reduction (p{$<$} 0.01) in mean ICA flow. Effects of changing downstream resistance and compliance were examined. For a given pressure waveform, reduction in downstream compliance led to altered waveform shape and reduction in peak systolic flow rates where the mean flow rates were not altered. Increased downstream resistance resulted in drastic reduction in mean flow rates.},

  abstract = {Considering the ever-increasing importance of marine gas hydrates, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of clathrate formation and decomposition in porous media. It is well established that, due to capillary effects, small-diameter pores - similar to those found in natural sediments - act to inhibit hydrate stability. However, accurate data constraining these effects are still lacking. Here, we present experimental methane clathrate dissociation data for 3.5 mass\% methanol aqueous solutions in confined silica glass pores of narrow distribution (30.6, 15.8, and 9.2 nm mean diameters). These data have been used to validate a thermodynamic model for clathrate stability porous media. Experimental data show a marked improvement on literature data - which we attribute to the experimental and interpretative methods used - and are in good agreement with the model predictions. Results suggest that mass transfer of inhibitors (methanol) and dissolved gas during clathrate formation/dissociation within the porous network plays an important role in controlling gas hydrate equilibria.},

  abstract = {The surface roughness of the coronary artery is associated with the onset of atherosclerosis. The study applies, for the first time, the micro-scale variation of the artery surface to a 3D coronary model, investigating the impact on haemodynamic parameters which are indicators for atherosclerosis. The surface roughness of porcine coronary arteries have been detailed based on optical microscopy and implemented into a cylindrical section of coronary artery. Several approaches to rheology are compared to determine the benefits/limitations of both single and multiphase models for multi-scale geometry. Haemodynamic parameters averaged over the rough/smooth sections are similar; however, the rough surface experiences a much wider range, with maximum wall shear stress greater than 6 Pa compared to the approximately 3 Pa on the smooth segment. This suggests the smooth-walled assumption may neglect important near-wall haemodynamics. While rheological models lack sufficient definition to truly encompass the micro-scale effects occurring over the rough surface, single-phase models (Newtonian and non-Newtonian) provide numerically stable and comparable results to other coronary simulations. Multiphase models allow for phase interactions between plasma and red blood cells which is more suited to such multi-scale models. These models require additional physical laws to govern advection/aggregation of particulates in the near-wall region.},

Each erythrocyte is represented by a dumbbell. The use of a linear spring law in the dumbbells leads to a multi-mode generalized Maxwell equation for the elastic stress and both the relaxation times and viscosities are functions of a time-dependent structure variable. An approximate constitutive equation is derived by choosing a single mode corresponding to the cell aggregate size where the largest number of cells are to be found. This size is identified in the case of steady flows. The model exhibits shear-thinning, viscoelasticity and thixotropy and these are clearly related to the microstructural properties of the fluid. Agreement with the experimental data of Bureau et al. [M. Bureau, J.C. Healy, D. Bourgoin, M.

The models are capable of describing the rheological behavior of un-aggregated suspensions of human red blood cells (RBCs). With the increase in shear rate, a shear-thinning behavior is predicted similar to that observed in the case of un-aggregated suspensions of RBCs. A decrease in relative viscosity and an enhancement of shear-thinning behavior is predicted when either the particle rigidity (elastic modulus) is decreased or the continuous medium viscosity is increased. These predictions are similar to those observed in suspensions of human RBCs. The proposed models are evaluated using experimental data on normal and hardened human RBC suspensions in protein-free saline.}

  abstract = {Inverse problems in cardiovascular modelling have become increasingly important to assess each patient individually. These problems entail estimation of patient-specific model parameters from uncertain measurements acquired in the clinic. In recent years, the method of data assimilation, especially the unscented Kalman filter, has gained popularity to address computational efficiency and uncertainty consideration in such problems. This work highlights and presents solutions to several challenges of this method pertinent to models of cardiovascular haemodynamics. These include methods to (i) avoid ill-conditioning of the covariance matrix, (ii) handle a variety of measurement types, (iii) include a variety of prior knowledge in the method, and (iv) incorporate measurements acquired at different heart rates, a common situation in the clinic where the patient state differs according to the clinical situation. Results are presented for two patient-specific cases of congenital heart disease. To illustrate and validate data assimilation with measurements at different heart rates, the results are presented on a synthetic dataset and on a patient-specific case with heart valve regurgitation. It is shown that the new method significantly improves the agreement between model predictions and measurements. The developed methods can be readily applied to other pathophysiologies and extended to dynamical systems which exhibit different responses under different sets of known parameters or different sets of inputs (such as forcing/excitation frequencies).},

This two-article series proposes that variable forces associated with diastolic RV/LV rotatory intraventricular flows can exert physiologically and clinically important, albeit still unappreciated, epigenetic actions influencing functional and morphological cardiac adaptations and/or maladaptations. Taken in toto, the two-part survey formulates a new paradigm in which intraventricular diastolic filling vortex-associated forces play a fundamental epigenetic role, and examines how heart cells react to these forces. The objectives are to provide a perspective on vortical epigenetic effects, to introduce emerging ideas, and to suggest directions of multidisciplinary translational research. The main goal is to make pertinent biophysics and cytomechanical dynamic systems concepts accessible to interested translational and clinical cardiologists. I recognize that the diversity of the epigenetic problems can give rise to a diversity of approaches and multifaceted specialized research undertakings. Specificity may dominate the picture. However, I take a contrasting approach. Are there concepts that are central enough that they should be developed in some detail? Broadness competes with specificity. Would, however, this viewpoint allow for a more encompassing view that may otherwise be lost by generation of fragmented results? Part 1 serves as a general introduction, focusing on background concepts, on intracardiac vortex imaging methods, and on diastolic filling vortex-associated forces acting epigenetically on RV/LV endocardium and myocardium. Part 2 will describe pertinent available pluridisciplinary knowledge/research relating to mechanotransduction mechanisms for intraventricular diastolic vortex forces and myocardial deformations and to their epigenetic actions on myocardial and ventricular function and adaptations.},

The vortex ring formation time (FT) concept, based on hydrodynamic experiments dealing with unconfined (large tank) flow, has attracted considerable attention and popularity. Dynamic conditions evolving within the very confined space of a filling, expansible ventricular chamber with relaxing and rebounding, and viscoelastic muscular boundaries diverge from unconfined (large tank) flow and encompass rebounding walls' suction and myocardial relaxation. Indeed, clinical/physiological findings seeking validation in vivo failed to support the notion that FT is an index of normal/abnormal diastolic ventricular function. Therefore, FT as originally proposed cannot and should not be utilized as such an index. Evidently, physiologically accurate models accounting for coupled hydrodynamic and (patho)physiological myocardial wall interactions with the intraventricular flow are still needed to enhance our understanding and yield diastolic function indices useful and reliable in the clinical setting.},

  abstract = {A general, numerical, marching procedure is presented for the calculation of the transport processes in three-dimensional flows characterised by the presence of one coordinate in which physical influences are exerted in only one direction. Such flows give rise to parabolic differential equations and so can be called three-dimensional parabolic flows. The procedure can be regarded as a boundary-layer method, provided it is recognised that, unlike earlier published methods with this name, it takes full account of the cross-stream diffusion of momentum, etc., and of the pressure variation in the cross-stream plane. The pressure field is determined by: first calculating an intermediate velocity field based on an estimated pressure field; and then obtaining appropriate correction so as to satisfy the continuity equation. To illustrate the procedure, calculations are presented for the developing laminar flow and heat transfer in a square duct with a laterally-moving wall. R\'esum\'e Une m\'ethode num\'erique g\'en\'erale est pr\'esent\'ee pour le calcul des processus de transport dans des \'ecoulements tridimensionnels caract\'eris\'es par la pr\'esence d'une coordonn\'ee pour laquelle les influences physiques sont sensibles dans une seule direction. De tels \'ecoulements donnent lieu \`a des \'equations aux d\'eriv\'ees partielles paraboliques et ainsi peuvent \^etre appel\'es \'ecoulements paraboliques tridimensionnels. La proc\'edure peut \^etre consid\'er\'ee comme une m\'ethode de couche limite mais on remarque que, contrairement \`a des m\'ethodes ant\'erieurement publi\'ees sous ce nom. elle tient enti\`erement compte de la diffusion transversale de quantit\'e de mouvement etc. et de la variation de pression dans le plan perpendiculaire \`a l'\'ecoulement.

  abstract = {Artificial organs within the blood stream are generally associated with flow-induced blood damage, particularly hemolysis of red blood cells. These damaging effects are known to be dependent on shear forces and exposure times. The determination of a correlation between these flow-dependent properties and actual hemolysis is the subject of this study. For this purpose, a Couette device has been developed. A fluid seal based on fluorocarbon is used to separate blood from secondary external damage effects. The shear rate within the gap is controlled by the rotational speed of the inner cylinder, and the exposure time by the amount of blood that is axially pumped through the device per given time. Blood damage is quantified by the index of hemolysis (IH), which is calculated from photometric plasma hemoglobin measurements. Experiments are conducted at exposure times from t\$\textbackslash backslash\$\_\{exp\}=25 - 1250 ms and shear rates ranging from {$\tau$}=30 up to 450 Pa ensuring Taylor-vortex free flow characteristics. Blood damage is remarkably low over a broad range of shear rates and exposure times. However, a significant increase in blood damage can be observed for shear stresses of tgrge 425 Pa and exposure times of texpge 620 ms. Maximum hemolysis within the investigated range is IH=3.5\%. The results indicate generally lower blood damage than reported in earlier studies with comparable devices, and the measurements clearly indicate a rather abrupt (i.e., critical levels of shear stresses and exposure times) than gradual increase in hemolysis, at least for the investigated range of shear rates and exposure times.},

  abstract = {Unsteady flow in a circular conduit with a smooth expansion is studied in detail by numerical integration of the equation of motion in the axisymmetric approximation. The values of governing parameters are chosen to be relevant to medical problems, and the geometry corresponds to a scenario of post-surgical conditions. The flow determined by an oscillatory volume is characterized by a sequence of vortex rings moving in the expanded part of the tube. The development of wall shear stress is governed by the separated translating vorticity which induces an evolving band of large intensity for about a complete oscillation cycle. This influences the dynamics of unsteady separation whose space-time development has revealed features of some generality which have been classified. The time variation of the pressure jump is dominated by inertial effects. The dependence of the details of the flow on the dimensionless parameters has been investigated systematically. The results obtained here have been compared with experimental and numerical studies of similar problems, similarities have been pointed out and differences discussed. Finally, the relevance of these results to physiological applications has been quantified by simulating the flow induced by a pulsatile flow rate.},

Cardiac blood motion is characterized by a vortical dynamics, and it is common belief that the cardiac vortex has a role in disease progressions or regression. Here we provide a preliminary demonstration about the relevance of maladaptive intra-cardiac vortex dynamics in the geometrical adaptation of the dysfunctional heart. We employed an in vivo model of patients who present a stable normal heart function in virtue of the cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT, bi-ventricular pace-maker) and who are expected to develop left ventricle remodeling if pace-maker was switched off. Intra-ventricular fluid dynamics is analyzed by echocardiography (Echo-PIV). Under normal conditions, the flow presents a longitudinal alignment of the intraventricular hemodynamic forces. When pacing is temporarily switched off, flow forces develop a misalignment hammering onto lateral walls, despite no other electro-mechanical change is noticed. Hemodynamic forces result to be the first event that evokes a physiological activity anticipating cardiac changes and could help in the prediction of longer term heart adaptations.},

We aim to demonstrate that these also modify global properties of the intraventricular blood flow pattern. We also explore whether such global changes present a relationship with clinical outcome.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 30 heart failure patients followed up after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). All subjects underwent echocardiography before implant and at follow-up after 6+ months. Left ventricular mechanics was investigated at follow-up during active CRT and was repeated after a temporary interruption {$<$}5 min later. Strain analysis, performed by speckle tracking, was used to assess the entity of contraction (global longitudinal strain) and its synchronicity (standard deviation of time to peak of radial strain). Intraventricular fluid dynamics, by echographic particle image velocimetry, was used to evaluate the directional distribution of global momentum associated with blood motion. The discontinuation of CRT pacing reflects into a reduction of deformation synchrony and into the deviation of blood flow momentum from the base-apex orientation with the development of transversal flow-mediated haemodynamic forces. The deviation of flow momentum presents a significant correlation with the degree of volumetric reduction after CRT.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Changes in electrical activation alter the orientation of blood flow momentum. The long-term CRT outcome correlates with the degree of re-alignment of haemodynamic forces. These preliminary results suggest that flow orientation could be used for optimizing the biventricular pacing setting. However, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Intraventricular pressure gradients or hemodynamic forces, which are their global measure integrated over the left ventricular volume, have a fundamental importance in ventricular function. They may help revealing a sub-optimal cardiac function that is not evident in terms of tissue motion, which is naturally heterogeneous and variable, and can influence cardiac adaptation. However, hemodynamic forces are not utilized in clinical cardiology due to the unavailability of simple non-invasive measurement tools. Hemodynamic forces depend on the intraventricular flow; nevertheless, most of them are imputable to the dynamics of the endocardial flow boundary and to the exchange of momentum across the mitral and aortic orifices. In this study, we introduce a simplified model based on first principles of fluid dynamics that allows estimating hemodynamic forces without knowing the velocity field inside the LV. The model is validated with 3D phase-contrast MRI (known as 4D flow MRI) in 15 subjects, (5 healthy and 10 patients) using the endocardial surface reconstructed from the three standard long-axis projections. Results demonstrate that the model provides consistent estimates for the base-apex component (mean correlation coefficient r=0.77 for instantaneous values and r=0.88 for root mean square) and good estimates of the inferolateral-anteroseptal component (r=0.50 and 0.84, respectively). The present method represents a potential integration to the existing ones quantifying endocardial deformation in MRI and echocardiography to add a physics-based estimation of the corresponding hemodynamic forces. These could help the clinician to early detect sub-clinical diseases and differentiate between different cardiac dysfunctional states.},

We investigated if this can be explained by changes in patterns of blood flow and wall shear stress. The luminal geometry of thoracic aortas from immature and mature rabbits was obtained by micro-CT of vascular corrosion casts. Blood flow was computed and average maps of wall shear stress were derived. The branch anatomy of the aortic arch varied widely between animals. Wall shear was increased downstream and to a lesser extent upstream of intercostal branch ostia, and a stripe of high shear was located on the dorsal descending aortic wall. The stripe was associated with two vortices generated by aortic arch curvature; their persistence into the descending aorta depended on aortic taper and was more pronounced in mature geometries. These results were not sensitive to the modelling assumptions. Blood flow characteristics in the rabbit aorta were affected by the degree of taper, which tends to increase with age in the aortic arch and strengthens secondary flows into the descending aorta. Previously-observed lesion distributions correlated better with high than low shear, and age-related changes around branch ostia were not explained by the flow patterns.},

Indeed, some studies have relied on the low shear theory when developing diagnostic and treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease. We wished to ascertain if this consensus is justified by published data. We performed a systematic review of papers that compare the localization of atherosclerotic lesions with the distribution of haemodynamic indicators calculated using computational fluid dynamics. The review showed that although many articles claim their results conform to the theory, it has been interpreted in different ways: a range of metrics has been used to characterize the distribution of disease, and they have been compared with a range of haemodynamic factors. Several studies, including all of those making systematic point-by-point comparisons of shear and disease, failed to find the expected relation. The various pre- and post-processing techniques used by different groups have reduced the range of shears over which correlations were sought, and in some cases are mutually incompatible. Finally, only a subset of the known patterns of disease has been investigated. The evidence for the low/oscillatory shear theory is less robust than commonly assumed. Longitudinal studies starting from the healthy state, or the collection of average flow metrics derived from large numbers of healthy vessels, both in conjunction with point-by-point comparisons using appropriate statistical techniques, will be necessary to improve our understanding of the relation between blood flow and atherogenesis.},

  abstract = {Background Palliative repair of single ventricle defects involve a series of open-heart surgeries where a single-ventricle (Fontan) circulation is established. As the patient ages, this paradoxical circulation gradually fails, because of its high venous pressure levels. Reversal of the Fontan paradox requires an extra subpulmonic energy that can be provided through mechanical assist devices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of a totally implantable integrated aortic-turbine venous-assist (iATVA) system, which does not need an external drive power and maintains low venous pressure chronically, for the Fontan circulation. Methods Blade designs of the co-rotating turbine and pump impellers were developed and 3 prototypes were manufactured. After verifying the single-ventricle physiology at a pulsatile in~vitro circuit, the hemodynamic performance of the iATVA system was measured for pediatric and adult physiology, varying the aortic steal percentage and circuit configurations. The iATVA system was also tested at clinical off-design scenarios. Results The prototype iATVA devices operate at approximately 800 revolutions per minute and extract up to 10\% systemic blood from the aorta to use this hydrodynamic energy to drive a blood turbine, which in turn drives a mixed-flow venous pump passively. By transferring part of the available energy from the single-ventricle outlet to the venous side, the iATVA system is able to generate up to approximately 5~mm Hg venous recovery while supplying the entire caval flow. Conclusions Our experiments show that a totally implantable iATVA system is feasible, which will eliminate the need for external power for Fontan mechanical venous assist and combat gradual postoperative venous remodeling and Fontan failure.},

Indeed, we seek to establish and analyze different rankings for programming languages based on their energy efficiency.

We have taken rigorous and strict solutions to 10 well defined programming problems, expressed in (up to) 27 programming languages, from the well known Computer Language Benchmark Game repository. This repository aims to compare programming languages based on a strict set of implementation rules and configurations for each benchmarking problem. We have also built a framework to automatically, and systematically, run, measure and compare the energy, time, and memory efficiency of such solutions. Ultimately, it is based on such comparisons that we propose a series of efficiency rankings, based on single and multiple criteria. Our results show interesting findings, such as how slower/faster languages can consume less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. We also present a simple way to use our results to provide software engineers and practitioners support in deciding which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern. In addition, we further validate our results and rankings against implementations from a chrestomathy program repository, Rosetta Code., by reproducing our methodology and benchmarking system. This allows us to understand how the results and conclusions from our rigorously and well defined benchmarked programs compare to those based on more representative and real-world implementations.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the interaction between a generic ventricular assist device (VAD) system and the three dimensional flow structure in a pathological left ventricle (LV). The MRI derived geometry motion data of the ventricular endothelial wall has been used as boundary condition for a three dimensional CFD model incorporating the placement of a VAD between the ventricular apex and the ascending aorta. In a first step, the pump action is implemented by simple momentum source terms, which is yet a placeholder for an arbitrary realistic pump system in future work. A two element circulatory system model is adjusted to physiological conditions and serves as an adaptive pressure boundary condition representing the capacity and resistance of the arterial circulatory system. The heart valves are modeled two dimensionally with a projected, realistic opening area. The computational model therefore accounts on the one hand for complex pressure flow interaction in time, like lumped parameter models do. On the other hand, the detailed three dimensional fluid flow structure is solved to analyze the effects of pump action on intra ventricular, intra aortic and pump cannula flow patterns. First simulation results indicate significant changes in the flow structure and therefore show relevance for the estimation of flow induced blood trauma caused directly and indirectly by VAD placement.},

  abstract = {This article describes the numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) validation of a new pumping concept and the possibility for application of a further developed type, as an implantable ventricular assist device (VAD). The novel principle of the so-called progressive wave pump is based on the interaction of an elastic membrane actuated by forced excitation with a surrounding fluid and the pump housing. By applying forced vibrations to one end of the membrane, a transversal wave builds up and progresses to the far end generating both a positive pressure gradient and flow rate. Among others, two axisymmetric geometrical configurations are possible, namely the discoidal and the tubular design. The first one has been built as a physical prototype and is experimentally investigated. In addition, a corresponding numerical FSI model is set up and validated against the experimental findings. Based on this validated numerical method, further numerical investigations are conducted focusing on the development of a tubular progressive wave pump concept with regard to its potential for application as a VAD in the future. To address VAD-relevant issues such as size, hydraulic performance, and blood trauma, corresponding numerical simulations involving macroscopic blood trauma models have been performed. Although being still in an early phase of development, the results are promising and indicate that the wave pump concept in its present state is feasible and can be further developed and investigated as a new type of blood pump. \textcopyright{} 2012, Copyright the Authors.

Prosthetic polymeric heart valves have the potential to overcome the inherent material and design limitations of these valves, but their development is still ongoing. The aim of this study was to characterize the hemodynamics and thrombogenic potential of the Polynova polymeric trileaflet valve prototype using a fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) approach. The FSI model replicated experimental conditions of the valve as tested in a left heart simulator. Hemodynamic parameters (transvalvular pressure gradient, flow rate, maximum velocity, and effective orifice area) were compared to assess the validity of the FSI model. The thrombogenic footprint of the polymeric valve was evaluated using a Lagrangian approach to calculate the stress accumulation (SA) values along multiple platelet trajectories and their statistical distribution. In the commissural regions, platelets were exposed to the highest SA values because of highest stress levels combined with local reverse flow patterns and vortices. Stress-loading waveforms from representative trajectories in regions of interest were emulated in our hemodynamic shearing device (HSD). Platelet activity was measured using our platelet activation state (PAS) assay and the results confirmed the higher thrombogenic potential of the commissural hotspots. In conclusion, the proposed method provides an in depth analysis of the hemodynamic and thrombogenic performance of the polymer valve prototype and identifies locations for further design optimization.},

  abstract = {Thrombolytic therapy is an effective means of treating thromboembolic diseases but can also give rise to life-threatening side effects. The infusion of a high drug concentration can provoke internal bleeding while an insufficient dose can lead to artery reocclusion. It is hoped that mathematical modelling of the process of clot lysis can lead to a better understanding and improvement of thrombolytic therapy. To this end, a multi-physics continuum model has been developed to simulate the dissolution of clot over time upon the addition of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The transport of tPA and other lytic proteins is modelled by a set of reaction-diffusion-convection equations, while blood flow is described by volume-averaged continuity and momentum equations. The clot is modelled as a fibrous porous medium with its properties being determined as a function of the fibrin fibre radius and voidage of the clot. A unique feature of the model is that it is capable of simulating the entire lytic process from the initial phase of lysis of an occlusive thrombus (diffusion-limited transport), the process of recanalization, to post-canalization thrombolysis under the influence of convective blood flow. The model has been used to examine the dissolution of a fully occluding clot in a simplified artery at different pressure drops. Our predicted lytic front velocities during the initial stage of lysis agreewell with experimental and computational results reported by others. Following canalization, clot lysis patterns are strongly influenced by local flowpatterns,which are symmetric at lowpressure drops, but asymmetric at higher pressure drops, which give rise to larger recirculation regions and extended areas of intense drug accumulation. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

  abstract = {Thromboembolic diseases such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are one of the main causes of death in the world. These pathologies occur when an abnormal blood clot develops in the human body and travels throughout the circulatory system as an embolus. If the occlusion takes place in the cerebral arteries, it can lead to acute ischemic stroke which, if not treated rapidly, will cause morbidity and death. One of the forms of treatment for ischemic stroke is thrombolytic therapy whereby a drug known as alteplase is provided intravenously to the patient so as to dissolve the occluding thrombus. This treatment, however, can provoke life-threatening side-effects such as intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and therefore is limited to only a subset of patients that are free of contraindications. Furthermore, thrombolytic therapy can sometimes be ineffective in treating certain types of occlusions.  As such, there is considerable interest in the medical community in determining the scenarios where thrombolytic therapy can be ineffective and how existing treatment can be optimised.     To this end, a multi-physics and multi-scale computational model has been developed in an attempt to simulate the treatment of ischemic stroke with thrombolytic therapy. Blood flow and drug transport are described by partial differential equations that are solved with the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Fibrinolysis is described using a microscale model whereby changes in the clot microstructure give rise to changes in macroscopic properties of the clot such as clot resistance and composition.  Arterial geometries include idealised models using CAD software and patient-specific models extracted from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. Physiological flow boundary conditions are implemented by using 3 element Windkessel models while drug transport boundary conditions are determined with the aid of a compartmental model. Clots of different shapes, lengths and locations are studied and their dissolution patterns are examined under different thrombolysis regimens.     Predicted changes in the intra-arterial flowrate and pressure are consistent with data in the literature. The results show that under the assumption of homogeneous clot properties, clot lysis patterns are strongly dependent on clot position, whereas clot dissolution time is merely determined by clot length. Numerical simulations of different thrombolysis regimens indicate that treatment dose and duration can be personalised according to clot length and clot composition in order to lower the risk of ICH (intracerebral haemorrhage) and ensure successful vessel recanalization. It is demonstrated that the computational model developed in this study can be used to investigate clot dissolution in patient-specific geometries. Future work will attempt to test the use of this computational model in clinical settings and as an aid in the development of new therapies.},

Although several studies have investigated the influence of BCs on predicted flow patterns and hemodynamic wall parameters in various arterial models, there is a lack of comprehensive assessment of outlet BCs for patient-specific analysis of aortic flow. In this study, five different sets of outlet BCs were tested and compared using a subject-specific model of a normal aorta. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) was performed on the same subject and velocity profiles extracted from the in vivo measurements were used as the inlet boundary condition. Computational results obtained with different outlet BCs were assessed in terms of their agreement with the PC-MRI velocity data and key hemodynamic parameters, such as pressure and flow waveforms and wall shear stress related indices. Our results showed that the best overall performance was achieved by using a well-tuned three-element Windkessel model at all model outlets, which not only gave a good agreement with in vivo flow data, but also produced physiological pressure waveforms and values. On the other hand, opening outlet BCs with zero pressure at multiple outlets failed to reproduce any physiologically relevant flow and pressure features.},

Subjects and Methods: Between July 1987 and December 2006, 1026 VADs were implanted in 970 patients. Most of them were men (81.9\%). The indications were: cardiomyopathy (n = 708), postcardiotomy heart failure (n = 173), acute myocardial infarction (n = 36), acute graft failure (n = 45), a VAD problem (n = 6), and others (n = 2). Mean age was 46.1 (range 3 days to 78) years. In 50.5\% of the patients the VAD implanted was left ventricular, in 47.9\% biventricular, and in 1.5\% right ventricular. There were 14 different types of VAD. A total artificial heart was implanted in 14 patients. Results: Survival analysis showed higher early mortality (p \&lt; 0.05) in the postcardiotomy group (50.9\%) than in patients with preoperative profound cardiogenic shock (31.1\%) and patients with preoperative end-stage heart failure without severe shock (28.9\%). A total of 270 patients were successfully bridged to heart transplantation (HTx). There were no significant differences in long-term survival after HTx among patients with and without previous VAD. In 76 patients the device could be explanted after myocardial recovery. In 72 patients the aim of implantation was permanent support. During the study period 114 patients were discharged home. Currently, 54 patients are on a device. Conclusions: VAD implantation may lead to recovery from secondary organ failure. Patients should be considered for VAD implantation before profound, possibly irreversible, cardiogenic shock occurs. In patients with postcardiotomy heart failure, a more efficient algorithm should be developed to improve survival. With increased experience, more VAD patients can participate in out-patient programs. (J Card Surg 2008;23:185-194)},

  abstract = {\{[\}1] Remote seismic methods, which measure the compressional wave ( P wave) velocity (V-p) and shear wave ( S wave) velocity ( Vs), can be used to assess the distribution and concentration of marine gas hydrates in situ. However, interpreting seismic data requires an understanding of the seismic properties of hydrate-bearing sediments, which has proved problematic because of difficulties in recovering intact hydrate-bearing sediment samples and in performing valid laboratory tests. Therefore a dedicated gas hydrate resonant column (GHRC) was developed to allow pressure and temperature conditions suitable for hydrate formation to be applied to a specimen with subsequent measurement of both V-p and V-s made at frequencies and strains relevant to marine seismic investigations. Thirteen sand specimens containing differing amounts of evenly dispersed hydrate were tested. The results show a bipartite relationship between velocities and hydrate pore saturation, with a marked transition between 3 and 5\% hydrate pore saturation for both V-p and V-s. This suggests that methane hydrate initially cements sand grain contacts then infills the pore space. These results show in detail for the first time, using a resonant column, how hydrate cementation affects elastic wave properties in quartz sand. This information is valuable for validating theoretical models relating seismic wave propagation in marine sediments to hydrate pore saturation.},

Here we show that methane may be released by the destabilization of methane clathrate hydrates, triggered by the interglacial climate change starting 0.4 Ma. Clathrate hydrates are nonstoichiometric crystalline compounds in which a water ice lattice forms cages that contain apolar gas molecules, such as methane [CH4{$\cdot$}nH2O] and carbon dioxide [CO2{$\cdot$}nH2O]. The loss of shallow ground ice eliminates confining pressure, initiating the destabilization of clathrate hydrates and the release of methane to the atmosphere. This alternative process does not restrict the methane's age to 430 yr (maximum residence time of methane gas in martian atmosphere), because clathrate hydrates can preserve (encage) methane of ancient origin for long time periods.},

  abstract = {Convection in a layer of fluid with a free surface due to a combination of thermocapillary stresses and buoyancy is one of the classic problems of fluid mechanics. Although extensively studied, it is still not fully understood. In particular, neither the effect of phase change nor the thermal boundary conditions at the liquid\textendash vapor interface have been properly described. These two intimately related issues have a significant impact on the stability of the flow and transitions between different convective patterns. The objective of this paper is to develop and validate a comprehensive numerical model which properly describes both heat transfer and phase change at the liquid\textendash vapor interface, as well as the transport of heat and vapor in the gas layer, which is ignored by the vast majority of theoretical studies with minimal justification. We present a numerical investigation of convection in a long cell filled with a volatile fluid and air, and investigate the changes in convective patterns due to with changes in the applied horizontal temperature gradient. We also explore how variations in the wetting properties of the fluid and lateral confinement (three-dimensionality) affect the flow. While the numerical results have been found to be in general agreement with existing experimental observations, we have also discovered an unexpected phenomenon: a region of evaporation near the cold wall and a region of condensation near the hot wall.},

From empirical grounds, the valuep = 1/2 holds for a large class of systems, like suspensions of rodand disc-shaped particles. In the high shear rate limit, aCasson law-type is recovered and discussed, especially the concentration dependence of the yield stress. However, the latter disappears in the low shear limit, and must be considered as a pseudo-yield stress. Good agreement is found in this low shear limit with some theoretical results ofBueche for polymers. More generally, the viscosity equation displays pseudo-plastic behaviour and fitting it on experimental data allows the determination of the structural parameters. Some examples (especially Red Blood Cell suspensions and Blood) are studied and support the model. Nevertheless, for spherical particle suspensions, the best fitting is reached forp = 1. Accurate values of particle diameters can be deduced from the structural parameter [dot over (term)] [gamma] .sub.c , in this case. In einer vorangegangenen Arbeit (1) wurde eine Viskositatsgleichung fur eine nicht-newtonsche Flussigkeit von der Form [eta] .sub.r = (1 - \textbackslash tfrac12 k[phi] ).sup. - 2 vorgeschlagen, worinI die Volumenkonzentration und k = (k.sub.0 + k.sub.[infinity] [dot over (term)] [gamma] .sub.r.sup.p )/(1 + [dot over (term)] [gamma] .sub.r.sup.p ) eine Grenzviskositat bedeutet; die letztere stellt eine Funktion der relativen Schergeschwindigkeit [dot over (term)] [gamma] .sub.r = [dot over (term)] [gamma] /[dot over (term)] [gamma] .sub.c dar, die Konstantenk .sub.0,k .sub.[infinity] und [dot over (term)] [gamma] .sub.c bezeichnen Strukturparameter. Empirisch wird gefunden, dass fur eine grosse Klasse von Systemen, wie z. B. stabchen- und scheibchenformigen Teilchen,p = 1/2 gilt. In der Grenze hoher Schergeschwindigkeiten wird ein Verlauf gemass einer Casson-Gleichung gefunden und diskutiert, insbesondere bezuglich der Konzentrationsabhangigkeit der Fliessspannung. Allerdings verschwindet diese in der Grenze niedriger Schergeschwindigkeiten und muss daher als Pseudo-Fliessspannung betrachtet werden. In diesem Grenzfall wird eine gute Ubereinstimmung mit theoretischen Voraussagen vonBueche an Polymeren gefunden. Ganz allgemein beschreibt die obige Viskositatsgleichung ein pseudoplastisches Verhalten, und ihre Anpassung an experimentelle Werte erlaubt die Bestimmung der Strukturparameter. Einige Beispiele, insbesondere Suspensionen von roten Blutkorperchen und Blut, werden untersucht und bestatigen das Modell. Allerdings erhalt man bei Suspensionen kugelformiger Teilchen die beste Anpassung furp = 1. In diesem Fall kann man mit Hilfe des Strukturparameters [dot over (term)] [gamma] .sub.c genaue Werte der Teilchendurchmesser bestimmen.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been renewed interest in estimating total arterial compliance. Because it cannot be measured directly, a lumped model is usually applied to derive compliance from aortic pressure and flow. The archetypical model, the classical two-element windkessel, assumes 1) system linearity and 2) infinite pulse wave velocity. To generalize this model, investigators have added more elements and have incorporated nonlinearities. A different approach is taken here. It is assumed that the arterial system 1) is linear and 2) has finite pulse wave velocity. In doing so, the windkessel is generalized by describing compliance as a complex function of frequency that relates input pressure to volume stored. By applying transmission theory, this relationship is shown to be a function of heart rate, peripheral resistance, and pulse wave reflection. Because this pressure-volume relationship is generally not equal to total arterial compliance, it is termed ``apparent compliance.'' This new concept forms the natural counterpart to the established concept of apparent pulse wave velocity.}

This work is an extension of a previous FDA-sponsored multi-laboratory study, which used a medical device mimicking geometry referred to as the FDA benchmark nozzle model. Experimental measurements were performed using time-resolved PIV at five overlapping regions of the model for Reynolds numbers in the nozzle throat of 500, 2000, 5000, and 8000. Images included a twofold increase in spatial resolution in comparison to the previous study. Data was processed using ensemble correlation, dynamic range enhancement, and phase correlations to increase signal-to-noise ratios and measurement accuracy, and to resolve flow regions with large velocity ranges and gradients, which is typical of many blood-contacting medical devices. Parameters relevant to device safety, including shear stress at the wall and in bulk flow, were computed using radial basis functions. In addition, in-field spatially resolved pressure distributions, Reynolds stresses, and energy dissipation rates were computed from PIV measurements. Velocity measurement uncertainty was estimated directly from the PIV correlation plane, and uncertainty analysis for wall shear stress at each measurement location was performed using a Monte Carlo model. Local velocity uncertainty varied greatly and depended largely on local conditions such as particle seeding, velocity gradients, and particle displacements. Uncertainty in low velocity regions in the sudden expansion section of the nozzle was greatly reduced by over an order of magnitude when dynamic range enhancement was applied. Wall shear stress uncertainty was dominated by uncertainty contributions from velocity estimations, which were shown to account for 90\textendash 99\% of the total uncertainty. This study provides advancements in the PIV processing methodologies over the previous work through increased PIV image resolution, use of robust image processing algorithms for near-wall velocity measurements and wall shear stress calculations, and uncertainty analyses for both velocity and wall shear stress measurements. The velocity and shear stress analysis, with spatially distributed uncertainty estimates, highlights the challenges of flow quantification in medical devices and provides potential methods to overcome such challenges.},

Whole blood is modeled as a suspension of deformable red blood cells (RBCs) and rigid platelets in a viscous liquid. The fluid phase is simulated using the lattice-Boltzmann method, the RBC membranes are modeled with a coarse-grained spectrin-link method, and the dynamics of rigid particles are updated using Newton's equations of motion for axisymmetric shapes. The results emphasize that an increase in hematocrit increases the rate of margination. The viscosity ratio between the interior cytoplasm and suspending fluid can considerably alter the rate of margination. The aspect ratio of surrogate platelet particles influences the rate of margination as well. Spherical particles tend to migrate more quickly than disks. Highly viscous or rigid RBCs slow down margination.},

  abstract = {Separation of particles from the carrier fluid of suspension is important in many engineering applications. In this work numerical simulations of particle migration during the flow of concentrated suspension through 3D asymmetric T-shaped bifurcating channels were carried out. The carrier fluids were considered to be non-Newtonian and inelastic. Diffusive flux model of shear-induced migration in conjugation with the power-law and Bird-Carreau constitutive models for the carrier fluid was used in the simulations. The velocity and particle concentration profiles in a non-Newtonian suspending fluid showed marked differences compared to that in the Newtonian carrier. Enhanced migration was observed in the case of shear thinning fluid while low for shear thickening. The symmetric velocity and concentration profiles in the inlet branch become asymmetric in the daughter branches and the degree of asymmetry strongly depends on the carrier fluid rheology. The results showed that the particle partitioning between daughter branches do not follow the fluid partitioning and the degree of separation depends on the relative volumetric flow rate of bulk suspension in the daughter branches. Higher separation efficiency was achieved for suspension in shear thinning fluid and relatively lower in Newtonian and shear thickening fluids.}

Preliminary investigations are made with the help of two-terminal probe and an accurate LCR meter. The bulk impedance of mango has been measured to characterise raw and ripe fruits. Effective resistance and effective capacitance vs. frequency characteristics have been determined. The bulk effective resistances, of the ripe fruits, are found to be more than those of the raw fruits, in the frequency range of 1\textendash 6 kHz. In the same frequency range, effective capacitances of the raw fruits are found more than those of the ripe fruits. In the light of the data obtained, it can be said that the effective resistance may be used to differentiate between raw and ripe fruits in the frequency range of 1\textendash 6 kHz.},

It is part of the skill of the pace bowlers to control this swing as much as they can. In a previous article in Parabola (Volume 15, Number 3) the swing of the cricket ball was discussed. I will summarise its main points and elaborate on them, but I will also discuss a relatively new discovery by fast bowlers \textendash{} the phenomenon of reverse swing. Balls curve in flight in many games, such as golf, soccer, tennis and so on, but this is due to the ball spinning about a vertical axis, which gives rise to what is known as the Magnus Effect.  This is entirely different to a cricket ball swinging, and will not be discussed here.},

Vortex meters are used in numerous branches of industry to measure the volumetric flow by exploiting the unsteady vortex flow behind a blunt body. The classical K\'arm\'an vortex street behind a cylinder shows a decrease in Strouhal number with decreasing Reynolds number. Considering the flow behind a vortex shedding device in a pipe the Strouhal-Reynolds number dependence shows a different behaviour for turbulent flows: a decrease in Reynolds number leads to an increase in Strouhal number. This phenomenon was found in the experimental investigations as well as in the numerical results and has been confirmed theoretically by a stability analysis.},

The availability of clinical data for geometric and elastic properties together with efficient numerical methods has now made model rendering feasible. This work uses 3-D fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) to provide physiological simulation resulting in modeling with a high level of detail. Comparisons are made between results using FSI and rigid wall models. The relevance of wall compliance in determining parameters of clinical importance, such as wall shear stress, is discussed together with the significance of differences found in the pressure and flow waveforms when using the 1-D model. Patient-specific geometry of the aorta and its branches was based on MRI angiography data. The arterial wall was created with a variable thickness. The boundary conditions for the fluid domain were pressure waveform at the ascending aorta and flow for each outlet. The waveforms were obtained using a 1-D model validated by in vivo measurements performed on the same person. In order to mimic the mechanical effect of surrounding tissues in the simulation, a stress\textendash displacement relation was applied to the arterial wall. The temporal variation and spatial patterns of wall shear stress are presented in the aortic arch and thoracic aorta together with differences using rigid wall and FSI models. A comparison of the 3-D simulations to the 1-D model shows good reproduction of the pressure and flow waveforms.},

The micro impedance pump was constructed of a simple thin-walled tube coupled at either end to glass capillary tubing and actuated electromagnetically. Through the cumulative effects of wave propagation and reflection originating from an excitation located asymmetrically along the length of the elastic tube, a pressure head can be established to drive flow. Flow rates were observed to be reversible and highly dependent on the profile of the excitation. Micro impedance pump flow studies were conducted in open and closed circuit flow configurations. Maximum flow rates of 16 ml min[?]1 have been achieved under closed loop flow conditions with an elastic tube diameter of 2 mm. Two size scales with channel diameters of 2 mm and 250 {$\mu$}m were also examined in open circuit flow, resulting in flow rates of 191 {$\mu$}l min[?]1 and 17 {$\mu$}l min[?]1, respectively.},

The method provides an objective asymptotic approach to quantification of uncertainty of grid convergence. The basic idea is to approximately relate the results from any grid refinement test to the expected results from a grid doubling using a second-order method. The GCI is based upon a grid refinement error estimator derived from the theory of generalized Richardson Extrapolation. It is recommended for use whether or not Richardson Extrapolation is actually used to improve the accuracy, and in some cases even if the conditions for the theory do not strictly hold. A different form of the GCI applies to reporting coarse grid solutions when the GCI is evaluated from a `'nearby'' problem. The simple formulas may be applied a posteriori by editors and reviewers, even if authors are reluctant to do so.},

However, existing techniques of harnessing muscle power, either directly to the heart or by constructing auxiliary skeletal muscle ventricles, have not achieved effective long-term cardiac assistance. A new concept for utilising the latissimus dorsi muscle for circulatory support has been devised that promises several physiological, mechanical and surgical advantages over current approaches. It is the subject of an application lodged at the European Patent Office by the University of Glasgow. The potential of the device to promote thrombogenesis needs to be minimised, and it is to this end that the work described in this thesis was initiated. Prototype artificial ventricles were fabricated in polyurethane and incorporated into a mock circulatory loop. The aim was to identify the best design from four geometrical variations in terms of fluid flow; specifically to characterise stagnation regions, fluid element residence times and high shear stresses. A novel fluid tracer technique was developed, utilising image processing, to produce colour maps of tracer concentration inside a pumping chamber. Three-dimensional fluid flow was characterised with a fluorescent particle tracer method and the aid of animation software. Areas of high shear stress were identified for further examination. These regions were then magnified and shear stress measurements made within them. With a view to future work in vivo, the bench model has been used to calibrate a radioactive tracer technique suitable for investigating the flow characteristics of blood in such a device. The best design was identified and recommendations for further design improvement were made.},

  abstract = {Computational simulation can be defined as any computer application which involves the numerical solution to a system of partial differential equations. In this paper, a broad overview is given of verification procedures for computational simulation. The two aspects of verification examined are code verification and solution verification. Code verification is a set of procedures developed to find coding mistakes that affect the numerical discretization. The method of manufactured solutions combined with order of accuracy verification is recommended for code verification, and this procedure is described in detail. Solution verification is used to estimate the numerical errors that occur in every computational simulation. Both round-off and iterative convergence errors are discussed, and a posteriori methods for estimating the discretization error are examined. Emphasis is placed on discretization error estimation methods based on Richardson extrapolation as they are equally applicable to any numerical method. Additional topics covered include calculating the observed order of accuracy, error bands, and practical aspects of mesh refinement.},

  abstract = {A three dimensional mechanical and numerical avian model with identical geometry was developed to investigate the aerodynamic performance of flapping flight for varying flow velocities and wing beat frequencies. The corresponding reduced frequencies range from k=0.22 to k=1.0 providing turbulent and unsteady flow. The model consists of a rigid body and elastic wings. Its shape was inspired by birds, but restricted by manufacturing and numerical specifications. Using a sinusoidal flapping about an off-centre axis parallel to the body axis and a phase-shifted pitching about the moving lateral wing axis the wing beat motion was realized. Wind tunnel tests with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) were performed to capture the velocity field around and behind the mechanical model for different reduced frequencies. Furthermore, simulations for the corresponding numerical model have been conducted by means of fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) simulation techniques providing a fully resolved flow field. The results were used to analyze the flow configurations and to validate the numerical and experimental setup for further investigations. The results of the numerical simulations and wind tunnel experiments are in good agreement and facilitate a reconstruction of the three dimensional vortex structures in the wake. The results show, that for all reduced frequencies, the wakes consist of a chain of interlocked vortex rings behind each wing. For high reduced frequencies, a shedding of small-scale vortices composing vortex sheets generates oppositely rotating upstroke (UVS) and downstroke (DVS) vortex structures which contain starting, stopping, tip and root vortices. For decreasing reduced frequencies, the upstroke becomes more aerodynamically active leading to a diffusion of the upstroke vortex structures.},

  abstract = {Left ventricular flow is intrinsically complex, three-dimensional and unsteady. Its features are susceptible to cardiovascular pathology and treatment, in particular to surgical interventions involving the valves (mitral valve replacement). To improve our understanding of intraventricular fluid mechanics and the impact of various types of prosthetic valves thereon, we have developed a custom-designed versatile left ventricular phantom with anatomically realistic moving left ventricular membrane. A biological, a tilting disc and a bileaflet valve (in two different orientations) were mounted in the mitral position and tested under the same settings. To investigate 3D flow within the phantom, a four-view tomographic particle image velocimetry setup has been implemented. The results compare side-by-side the evolution of the 3D flow topology, vortical structures and kinetic energy in the left ventricle domain during the cardiac cycle. Except for the tilting disc valve, all tested prosthetic valves induced a crossed flow path, where the outflow crosses the inflow path, passing under the mitral valve. The biological valve shows a strong jet with a peak velocity about twice as high compared to all mechanical heart valves, which makes it easier to penetrate deeply into the cavity. Accordingly, the peak kinetic energy in the left ventricle in case of the biological valve is about four times higher than the mechanical heart valves. We conclude that the tomographic particle imaging velocimetry setup provides a useful ground truth measurement of flow features and allows a comparison of the effects of different valve types on left ventricular flow patterns.},

The mean thickness at each site was not different between men and women but increased significantly with age (p {$<$} 0.001). For 3 age groups ({$<$} 20, 20 to 59 and {$\geq$} 60 years), the corresponding mean thicknesses (mm) of the aortic nodule were 0.67, 0.87 and 1.42; those for the anterior mitral leaflet were 1.30, 1.60 and 3.20; and those for the posterior mitral leaflet were 0.91, 1.13 and 2.04. For the aortic valve, the nodule was nearly twice as thick as the closing edge (p {$<$} 0.001), and the closing edge was at least 25\% thicker than the middle part (p {$<$} 0.001). Furthermore, the posterior aortic cusp was thicker than the right and left cusps (p {$<$} 0.05). For both mitral leaflets, the closing edge was thicker than the clear zone (p {$<$} 0.05). Moreover, along the closing edges, the anterior leaflet was thicker than the posterior leaflet (p {$<$} 0.05).

Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers and directly perfused ex vivo over various well-defined eccentric stenoses. Shear-induced platelet activation was determined by using flow cytometry to assess: 1) GPlIb-IIIa activation by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Mab PAC-1; and 2) translocation of membrane aminophospholipids (procoagulant activity) by FITClabeled Annexin v. Microparticle formation was measured by flow cytometry and FITC-labeled Mab Y2/51 directed against GPlIla. Significant platelet activation and platelet microparticle formation were elicited when the wall shear rate reached 10,500 sec-1 for a period of 0.075 sec. Prolonged exposure to or a rapid increase in shear further enhanced activation and microparticle formation. Shear-induced platelet activation was associated with significantly increased collagen-induced platelet thrombus formation that was insensitive to aspirin ingestion. Exposure of native blood to very high shear thus activates platelets to express GPlIb.lIla, renders the platelet membrane procoagulant and stimulates microparticle formation. These responses are associated with enhanced collagen-induced thrombus formation by prostaglandin-independent mechanisms. @ 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study investigates how hypertension and hypotension may influence aneurysmal hemodynamics. Images of 23 IAs at typical locations were used to build patient-specific Computational Fluid Dynamics models. The effects of hypotension and hypertension were simulated through boundary conditions by modulating the normotensive flow and pressure waveforms, in turn produced by a 1D systemic vascular model. Aneurysm location and flow pattern types were used to categorize the influence of hypotension and hypertension on relevant flow variables (velocity, pressure and wall shear stress). Results indicate that, compared to other locations, vertebrobasilar aneurysms (VBA) are more sensitive to flow changes. In VBAs, space-averaged velocity at peak systole increased by 30\% in hypertension (16-21\% in other locations). Flow in VBAs in hypotension decreased by 20\% (10-13\% in other locations). Momentum-driven hemodynamic types were also more affected by hypotension and hypertension, than shear-driven types. This study shows how patient-specific modeling can be effectively used to identify location-specific flow patterns in a clinically-relevant study, thus reinforcing the role played by modeling technologies in furthering our understanding of cardiovascular disease, and their potential in future healthcare.},

[1 has been shown by expressing GPVI in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells that GPVI mediates adhesion to type I collagen under static conditions. However, the ability of GPVI to secure adhesion to collagen type I under ftow has not been measured. We studied the interaction of GPVI and type I collagen under hydrodynamic ftow using RBL-2H3 cells transfected with the GPVI receptor. We found that GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells adhere to collagen under ftow, significantly more so than non-GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cells. Inhibition of GPVI by the I I A 12 anti-GPVI antibody significantIy blocks adhesion to collagen, indicating that GPVI specifically interacts with collagen. Probing the role of signaling in GPVI binding to collagen, we used mutants ofGPVI and observed that signal transduction did not illhibit adhesion. To test the correlation between receptor expression and adhesion, we tested three GPVI-expressing RBL-2H3 cell lines (A. B. and C) with different levels of receptor expression. At a single shear rate, the level of adhesion increases monotonically with surrace expression. The results, using this model cell linc, indicate that GPVI is capable of mediating adhesion to collagen under shear, in a density-dependent fashion that is independent of GPVI signaling.

Although gas hydrate that crops out is transiently unstable, the larger volume of structure II gas hydrate in the gulf is stable or increasing in volume because gas from the subsurface petroleum system is venting prolifically within the gas hydrate stability zone. Vent gas from gas hydrate shows no meaningful molecular evidence of gas hydrate decomposition. Gas hydrate fabrics, mainly vein fillings, are typical of ongoing crystallization. Once crystallized, most hydrocarbons are protected from bacteria within the crystal lattice of gas hydrate. A leaky petroleum system is proposed to be the main source of thermogenic greenhouse gases in the central gulf. Stable gas hydrate sequesters large volumes of greenhouse gases, suggesting that gas hydrate may not be a significant factor in models of climate change at present.},

These forces are sensed by the mechanoreceptors of the vessel wall to give the proper response for homeostasis maintenance. Baroreceptors are a kind of mechanoreceptors which are sensitive to the abnormal stretch magnitudes. Therefore to assess the function of these receptors, predicting the stress and stretch distributions induced by the hemodynamic field to the arterial wall is crucial in the barosensitive regions. In this study, 3D patient-specific models of the aortic arch and carotid bifurcation which are the common positions of the baroreceptors are presented. Geometries were reconstructed based on MRI images and pulsatile numerical analysis was performed considering fluid-structure interaction. The hemodynamic field containing the velocity, WSS and pressure distributions was discussed in the fluid domain and the stress and deformation fields were analyzed in the solid domain. Comparing the temporal variations of pressure and circumferential stretch at the two barosensitive regions, the circumferential stretch is proposed as the criterion for quantifying the function of baroreceptors.},

Methods: The cusp height was measured intraoperatively in 621 patients during aortic valve repair procedures. A tricuspid anatomy was present in 329 patients and bicuspid in 286 patients. In addition, patient age, gender, height, weight, preoperative degree of aortic regurgitation, and aortic dimensions were recorded. The data were analyzed for possible interrelation between the cusp height and clinical variables. Results: In the bicuspid valves, the geometric height of the nonfused cusp ranged from 15 to 30 mm (mean, 23.8 {$\pm$} 2.0). Significant correlations were found between the cusp height and all clinical variables. In the tricuspid valves, the height of the noncoronary cusp ranged from 14 to 28 mm (mean, 20.7 {$\pm$} 2.2). The height of the left coronary cusp varied from 12 to 25 mm (mean, 20.0 {$\pm$} 2.1) and that of the right coronary cusp from 12 to 25 mm (mean, 20.0 {$\pm$} 2.1). The noncoronary cusp was significantly greater than the left and the right coronary cusp (P =.000). No difference was found between the left and right cusps (P =.513). Significant correlations between the geometric height and clinical parameters were found for most clinical variables, excluding the degree of aortic regurgitation. Conclusions: We found the cusp height was larger than previously published. It shows marked variability and correlates with the clinical variables. These data might serve as the basis for decision making in aortic valve repair. \textcopyright{} 2013 by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method has been developed to simulate the flow in a pumping left ventricle. The proposed method uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to provide a patient specific, time dependent geometry of the ventricle to be simulated. Standard clinical imaging procedures were used in this study. A two-dimensional time-dependent orifice representation of the heart valves was used. The location and size of the valves is estimated based on additional long axis images through the valves. A semi-automatic grid generator was created to generate the calculation grid. Since the time resolution of the MR scans does not fit the requirements of the CFD calculations a third order bezier approximation scheme was developed to realize a smooth wall boundary and grid movement. The calculation was performed by a Navier-Stokes solver using the arbitrary Lagrange-Euler (ALE) formulation. Results show that during diastole, blood flow through the mitral valve forms an asymmetric jet, leading to an asymmetric development of the initial vortex ring. These flow features are in reasonable agreement with in vivo measurements but also show an extremely high sensitivity to the boundary conditions imposed at the inflow. Changes in the atrial representation severely alter the resulting flow field. These shortcomings will have to be addressed in further studies, possibly by inclusion of the real atrial geometry, and imply additional requirements for the clinical imaging processes.},

  abstract = {Numerical methods are rapidly gaining importance for answering medical questions. One field in which these answer are especially valuable is cardiology. The understanding of the cardiac function on a detailed, physical level can help to improve diagnostics, prognosis and therapy for a large number of pathologies. The KaHMo (Karlsruhe Heart Model) is developed as a framework for the patient specific numerical simulation of the intraventricular flow. The framework combines different methods from several disciplines. As a means to simulate the cardiac flow in a given patient specific heart, KaHMo MRI derives the time dependent geometry of the endocardium and performs a numerical simulation of the intraventricular flow. In order to be able to predict the influence of pathological changes in e.g. the myocardium or the valves on the contraction of the heart and the flow driven by this movement, KaHMo FSI employs special Fluid-Structure-Interaction methods and a composite approach to muscular dynamics to simulate the complex interaction of non linear elastomechanics with hemodynamics. The framework is supported by additional models which include a model of the human circulatory system to derive the systemic pressure response, rheological models for the non- Newtonian behaviour of the blood as well as models for prediction of hemolysis and thrombosis risks in artificial blood pumps or ventricular assist devices. Future developments may incorporate electrodynamical models to include the possibility to predict the effect of e.g. arrythmia or therapeutical ablation on the heart function. The vision is a macroscopic holistic model of the human heart that can help to answer the ever pressing what if? questions.},

The hemodynamics of ventricular and vascular flow is closely linked to other disciplines like structural mechanics of myocardial and vascular tissue, electro-dynamical excitation, etc. A multi-disciplinary approach is therefore needed to describe it. While a monolithic solution of the underlying differential equations in one set is thinkable, a partitioned approach can take into account the specifics of the single disciplines and profit from specialized models and algorithms. We show how by coupling specialized solvers for fluid and solid mechanics a coupled model of ventricular flow can be created that gives insight into the hemodynamics in a way that is more than the sum of its parts.},

To compute patient-specific wall shear stress, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is required. In this study we propose a method for computing the pressure-drop in regions proximal and distal to a plaque, which can serve as a boundary condition in CFD. As a first step towards exploring the proposed method we investigated ten straightened coronary arteries. First, the flow fields were calculated with CFD and velocity profiles were fitted on the results. Second, the Navier-Stokes equation was simplified and solved with the found velocity profiles to obtain a pressure-drop estimate ({$\Delta$}p (1)). Next, {$\Delta$}p (1) was compared to the pressure-drop from CFD ({$\Delta$}p CFD) as a validation step. Finally, the velocity profiles, and thus the pressure-drop were predicted based on geometry and flow, resulting in {$\Delta$}p geom. We found that {$\Delta$}p (1) adequately estimated {$\Delta$}p CFD with velocity profiles that have one free parameter {$\beta$}. This {$\beta$} was successfully related to geometry and flow, resulting in an excellent agreement between {$\Delta$}p CFD and {$\Delta$}p geom: 3.9 {$\pm$} 4.9\% difference at Re = 150. We showed that this method can quickly and accurately predict pressure-drop on the basis of geometry and flow in straightened coronary arteries that are mildly diseased.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that shear stress activates platelets. However, this may have two linked but separate causes: a direct effect of shear stress on individual platelets, and secondary inter-platelet activation dependent on the release of agonists caused by shear. Gel-filtered platelets were exposed to intermittent low shear at 20,000 and 200,000 platelets/f11 and their activation was measured with a prothrombinase-based assay. At the lower count, activation was slow and essentially linear, but at the higher count, it rose exponentially with time, leading to 3-fold more prothrombinase activity. Inclusion of apyrase and/or prostaglandin 12 slightly reduced activation at high platelet counts, but did not abolish the nonlinear kinetics, and antibodies against von Willebrand factor had no significant effect. The contributions of anionic phospholipid and factor Va to the prothrombinase activity were assessed by measurements in the presence of exogenous factor Va. The results strongly suggest that anionic phospholipid appearance is caused directly by shear exposure, but that factor Va release from the agranules is a secondary event ali\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\}{$f\lbrace$}\AE\vphantom\{\}'\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\},\textbackslash\^A\vphantom\{\}\textasciimacron\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\}{$f\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\backslash$}\^a\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\texteuro\v{s}\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\},\textbackslash\^A\vphantom\{\}?`\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\}{$f\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\backslash$}\^a\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\texteuro\v{s}\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\},\textbackslash\^A\vphantom\{\}{$\frac{1}{2}$} 1argely trle I;esult of platelet-platelet signaling.},

We reported the case of a 65-year-old female patient in severe cardiogenic shock undergoing left (Jarvik 2000 axial flow pump) and right (Levitronix-Centrimag centrifugal pump) ventricular assist device implant. Evaluation of blood flow was obtained by ultrasonic flowmetry, continuous thermodilution technique, and pressure recording analytical method (PRAM). This pulse contour system allows beat-by-beat systemic blood flow assessment from the analysis of radial artery pressure waveform. At a Jarvik pump speed [\&le;] 10 000 rotations per minutes (rpm), thermodilution and PRAM showed similar blood flow values. At a Jarvik pump speed [\&ge;]11 000 rpm, the aortic valve did not open and PRAM did not provide blood flow values due to nonpulsatile blood flow. The present paper describes the first experience with PRAM in a single patient on MCS. Further studies are required to assess the validity of PRAM as an additional monitoring system in the setting of ventricular assist device support. Perfusion (2007) 22, 63-66.},

In the narrowest capillaries, these cells move in single file with a surrounding lubricating layer of plasma. In larger vessels, the red blood cells migrate toward the centerline, reducing the resistance to blood flow. Vessel walls are coated with a layer of macromolecules that restricts flow. At diverging bifurcations, hematocrit is not evenly distributed in the downstream vessels. Other particles are driven toward the walls by interactions with red blood cells. These physiologically important phenomena are discussed here from a fluid mechanical perspective.},

CPPM was lower in pigs than in dogs at baseline (0.72 {$\pm$} 0.23 vs. 1.14 {$\pm$} 0.29 ml/mmHg,P {$<$} 0.05) and after embolism (0.37 {$\pm$} 0.14 vs. 0.54 {$\pm$} 0.16 ml/mmHg, P = 0.07) at matched flow, but not at matched flow and pressure. CPPM showed the expected inverse relation with pressure and a direct relation with flow. CWK-3 was closely correlated with CPPM, except for all dogs at baseline where CWK-3 was up to 100\% higher than CPPM. Excluding these data, regression analysis yielded CWK-3 = -0.01 + 1.30 {$\cdot$} CPPM(r2 = 0.97). CWK-3 was found to be unreliable when input impedance first harmonic modulus was close to characteristic impedance, i.e., when reflections were small. SV/PP correlated well with CPPM (SV/PP = -0.10 + 1.76 {$\cdot$} CPPM,r2 = 0.89). We conclude that 1) CPPM is a consistent estimate of pulmonary arterial compliance in pigs and dogs,2) CWK-3 and SV/PP overestimate compliance, and 3) CWK-3 is unreliable when wave reflections are small.},

The leaflets of the mitral valve interact with the mitral jet and significantly impact diastolic flow patterns, but the effect of mitral valve morphology and kinematics on diastolic flow and its implications for left ventricular function have not been clearly delineated. In the present study, we employ computational hemodynamic simulations to understand the effect of mitral valve leaflets on diastolic flow. A computational model of the left ventricle is constructed based on a high-resolution contrast computed-tomography scan, and a physiological inspired model of the mitral valve leaflets is synthesized from morphological and echocardiographic data. Simulations are performed with a diode type valve model as well as the physiological mitral valve model in order to delineate the effect of mitral-valve leaflets on the intraventricular flow. The study suggests that a normal physiological mitral valve promotes the formation of a circulatory (or "looped") flow pattern in the ventricle. The mitral valve leaflets also increase the strength of the apical flow, thereby enhancing apical washout and mixing of ventricular blood. The implications of these findings on ventricular function as well as ventricular flow models are discussed.},

The complex rheology of blood is influenced by numerous factors including plasma viscosity, rate of shear, hematocrit, level of erythrocytes aggregation and deformability. Hemodynamic analysis of blood flow in vascular beds and prosthetic devices requires the rheological behaviour of blood to be characterized through appropriate constitutive equations relating the stress to deformation and rate of deformation.The objective of this paper is to present a short overview of some macroscopic constitutive models that can mathematically characterize the rheology of blood and describe its known phenomenological properties. Some numerical simulations obtained in geometrically reconstructed real vessels will be also presented to illustrate the hemodynamic behaviour using Newtonian and non-Newtonian inelastic models under a given set of physiological flow conditions.},

This data encodes a wealth of information that is often under-utilized. Modeling (and measuring) blood flow in the large vessels typically amounts to solving for the time-varying velocity field in a region of interest. Flow in the heart and larger arteries is often complex, and velocity field data provides a starting point for investigating the hemodynamics. This data can be used to perform Lagrangian particle tracking, and other Lagrangian-based postprocessing. As described herein, Lagrangian methods are necessary to understand inherently transient hemodynamic conditions from the fluid mechanics perspective, and to properly understand the biomechanical factors that lead to acute and gradual changes of vascular function and health. The goal of the present paper is to review Lagrangian methods that have been used in post-processing velocity data of cardiovascular flows.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional and pulsatile blood flow in a human aortic arch and its three major branches has been studied numerically for a peak Reynolds number of 2500 and a frequency (or Womersley) parameter of 10. The simulation geometry was derived from the three-dimensional reconstruction of a series of two-dimensional slices obtained in vivo using CAT scan imaging on a human aorta. The numerical simulations were obtained using a projection method, and a finite-volume formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations was used on a system of overset grids. Our results demonstrate that the primary flow velocity is skewed towards the inner aortic wall in the ascending aorta, but this skewness shifts to the outer wall in the descending thoracic aorta. Within the arch branches, the flow velocities were skewed to the distal walls with flow reversal along the proximal walls. Extensive secondary flow motion was observed in the aorta, and the structure of these secondary flows was influenced considerably by the presence of the branches. Within the aorta, wall shear stresses were highly dynamic, but were generally high along the outer wall in the vicinity of the branches and low along the inner wall, particularly in the descending thoracic aorta. Within the branches, the shear stresses were considerably higher along the distal walls than along the proximal walls. Wall pressure was low along the inner aortic wall and high around the branches and along the outer wall in the ascending thoracic aorta. Comparison of our numerical results with the localization of early atherosclerotic lesions broadly suggests preferential development of these lesions in regions of extrema (either maxima or minima) in wall shear stress and pressure.},

  abstract = {Although bulk changes in red blood cell concentration between vessels have been well characterised, local distributions are generally overlooked. Red blood cells aggregate, deform and migrate within vessels, forming heterogeneous distributions which have considerable effect on local haemodynamics. The present study reports data on the local distribution of human red blood cells in a sequentially bifurcating microchannel, representing the branching geometry of the microvasculature. Imaging methodologies with simple extrapolations are used to infer three dimensional, time-averaged velocity and haematocrit distributions under a range of flow conditions. Strong correlation between the bluntness of the velocity and haematocrit profiles in the parent branch of the geometry is observed and red blood cell aggregation has a notable effect on the observed trends. The two branches of the first bifurcation show similar characteristics in terms of the shapes of the profiles and the extent of plasma skimming, despite the difference in geometric configuration. In the second bifurcation, considerable asymmetry between the branches in the plasma skimming relationship is observed, and elucidated by considering individual haematocrit profiles. The results of the study highlight the importance of considering local haematocrit distributions in the analysis of blood flow and could lead to more accurate computational models of blood flow in microvascular networks. The experimental approaches developed in this work provide a foundation for further examining the characteristics of microhaemodynamics.},

  abstract = {We developed and validated a new, more accurate, and easily applied method for calculating the parameters of the three-element Windkessel to quantitate arterial properties and to investigate ventriculoarterial coupling. This method is based on integrating the governing differential equation of the three-element Windkessel and solving for arterial compliance. It accounts for the interaction between characteristic impedance and compliance, an important phenomenon that has been ignored by previously implemented methods. The new integral method was compared with four previously published methods as well as a new independent linear least-squares analysis, using ascending aortic micromanometric and volumetric flow measurements from eight dogs. The parameters calculated by the new integral method were found to be significantly different from those obtained by the previous methods but did not differ significantly from maximum likelihood estimators obtained by a linear leastsquares approach. To assess the accuracy of parameter estimation, pressure and flow waveforms were reconstructed in the time domain by numerically solving the governing differential equation of the three-element Windkessel model. Standard deviations of reconstructed waveforms from the experimental ensemble-averaged waveforms, which solely reflect the relative accuracy of the Windkessel parameters given by the various methods, were calculated. The new integral method invariably yielded the smallest error. These results demonstrate the improved accuracy of our new integral method in estimating arterial parameters of the three-element Windkessel.}

  abstract = {Many physiological systems involve strong interactions between fluids and solids, posing a significant challenge when modeling biomechanics. The objective of this study was to implement a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver in the free, open-source finite element code FEBio, that combined the existing solid mechanics and rigid body dynamics solver with a recently developed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver. A novel Galerkin-based finite element FSI formulation was introduced based on mixture theory, where the FSI domain was described as a mixture of fluid and solid constituents that have distinct motions. The mesh was defined on the solid domain, specialized to have zero mass, negligible stiffness, and zero frictional interactions with the fluid, whereas the fluid was modeled as isothermal and compressible. The mixture framework provided the foundation for evaluating material time derivatives in a material frame for the solid and in a spatial frame for the fluid. Similar to our recently reported CFD solver, our FSI formulation did not require stabilization methods to achieve good convergence, producing a compact set of equations and code implementation. The code was successfully verified against benchmark problems from the FSI literature and an analytical solution for squeeze-film lubrication. It was validated against experimental measurements of the flow rate in a peristaltic pump and illustrated using non-Newtonian blood flow through a bifurcated carotid artery with a thick arterial wall. The successful formulation and implementation of this FSI solver enhance the multiphysics modeling capabilities in febio relevant to the biomechanics and biophysics communities.},

To design and build MAVs with performance comparable to natural flyers, it is essential that natural flyers' combined flexible structural dynamics and aerodynamics are adequately understood.

  abstract = {Co-simulation is becoming an increasingly integral and indispensable technique for solving today's challenging engineering problems. By means of this code coupling technique, the engineering problem is partitioned as an assembly of different subsystems exchanging solution information at run time. The inherent advantage of co-simulation in contrast to the monolithic approach is that it allows the (re)use of well-established and specialized simulation software to be combined, with minor alterations. Furthermore, co-simulation allows different fidelity models to be combined at different stages of the design process. Unfortunately, this partitioned treatment of the individual system poses stability and accuracy challenges. A novel co-simulation algorithm is introduced, referred to as the Interface Jacobian-based Co-Simulation Algorithm (IJC\textbackslash -SA), which overcomes present stability issues. The algorithm can solve co-simulation scenarios involving an arbitrary number of fields and signals. Due to the fact that the IJCSA is based on the residual form it handles algebraic loops in a natural manner. Furthermore, the individual simulators can run in parallel without flow dependency reducing the wall-clock time of the simulation, since the subsystems do not have to be executed using the classical Gauss-Seidel pattern. A thorough stability analysis of the IJCSA is presented. In order to demonstrate the applicability, several industrially relevant examples are solved by using the IJCSA. The shown examples range from a fully coupled fluid-structure-signal interaction with closed-loop control to fully coupled emergency brake maneuver of a wind turbine. Here the interaction of the generator/gearbox, flexible composite blades, control unit and the three-dimensional flow field is taken into account. Furthermore, the simulation results are validated against measurement data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase VI, performed in the NASA AMES wind tunnel.},

  abstract = {Characterising circulatory dysfunction and choosing a suitable treatment is often difficult and time consuming, and can result in a deterioration in patient condition, or unsuitable therapy choices. A stable minimal model of the human cardiovascular system (CVS) is developed with the ultimate specific aim of assisting medical staff for rapid, on site modelling to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Models found in the literature simulate specific areas of the CVS with limited direct usefulness to medical staff. Others model the full CVS as a closed loop system, but they were found to be very complex, difficult to solve, or unstable. This paper develops a model that uses a minimal number of governing equations with the primary goal of accurately capturing trends in the CVS dynamics in a simple, easily solved, robust model. The model is shown to have long term stability and consistency with non-specific initial conditions as a result. An ``open on pressure close on flow'' valve law is created to capture the effects of inertia and the resulting dynamics of blood flow through the cardiac valves. An accurate, stable solution is performed using a method that varies the number of states in the model depending on the specific phase of the cardiac cycle, better matching the real physiological conditions. Examples of results include a 9\% drop in cardiac output when increasing the thoracic pressure from -4 to 0 mmHg, and an increase in blood pressure from 120/80 to 165/130 mmHg when the systemic resistance is doubled. These results show that the model adequately provides appropriate magnitudes and trends that are in agreement with existing data for a variety of physiologically verified test cases simulating human CVS function.},

For a flat plate at zero angle of attack, the reattachment length of the bubble depends on the plate thickness t. At a nonzero incidence, instead, the underlying scale governing bubble length is not clear. To investigate, we undertake a critical review of experimental and theoretical studies and develop an analytical formulation to predict the reattachment length of plates both at zero and at small incidences. We focus on conditions where the bubble is turbulent, i.e., when transition occurs at a negligible distance from the point of separation.

  abstract = {In the multidisciplinary field of heart research it is of utmost importance to identify accurate myocardium material properties for the description of phenomena such as mechano-electric feedback or heart wall thickening. A rationally-based material model is required to understand the highly nonlinear mechanics of complex structures such as the passive myocardium under different loading conditions. Unfortunately, to date there are no experimental data of human heart tissues available to estimate material parameters and to develop adequate material models. This study aimed to determine biaxial extension and triaxial shear properties and the underlying microstructure of the passive human ventricular myocardium. Using new state-of-the-art equipment, planar biaxial extension tests were performed to determine the biaxial extension properties of the passive ventricular human myocardium. Shear properties of the myocardium were examined by triaxial simple shear tests performed on small cubic specimens excised from an adjacent region of the biaxial extension specimens. The three-dimensional microstructure was investigated through second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy on optically cleared tissues, which emphasized the 3D orientation and dispersion of the myofibers and adjacent collagen fabrics. The results suggest that the passive human LV myocardium under quasi-static and dynamic multiaxial loadings is a nonlinear, anisotropic (orthotropic), viscoelastic and history-dependent soft biological material undergoing large deformations. Material properties of the tissue components along local microstructural axes drive the nonlinear and orthotropic features of the myocardium. SHG microscopy investigation revealed detailed information about the myocardial microstructure due to its high resolution. It enabled the identification of structural parameters such as the fiber and the sheet orientations and corresponding dispersions. With this complete set of material data, a sophisticated material model and associated material parameters can be defined for a better description of the biomechanical response of the ventricular myocardium in humans. Such a model will lead to more accurate computational simulations to better understand the fundamental underlying ventricular mechanics, a step needed in the improvement of medical treatment of heart diseases. Statement of Significance Unfortunately, to date there are no experimental data of human heart tissues available for material parameter estimation and the development of adequate material models. In this manuscript novel biaxial tensile and shear test data at different specimen orientations are presented, which allowed to adequately capture the direction-dependent material response. With these complete sets of mechanical data, combined with their underlying microstructural data (also presented herein), sophisticated material models and associated material parameters can be defined for the description of the mechanical behavior of the ventricular myocardium in humans. Such models will lead to accurate computational simulations to better understand the fundamental underlying ventricular mechanics, a step needed in the improvement of medical treatment of heart diseases.}

These two transient conditions correspond to time varying boundary conditions and transient rotational sliding interfaces in computational fluid dynamics (CFO). CFD was used to investigate the pump's performance under these dynamic fiow conditions. A quasi-steady analysis was also conducted to evaluate the difference between the steady and transient analyses and demonstrate the signjficance of transient analysis, especially for transient rotational sliding interfaces transient simulations. This transient flow analysis can be applied generally in the design process of lVADs; it provides more reliable fluid forces and moments on the impeller for successful design of the magnetic suspension system and motor.

  abstract = {As the pulsatile cardiac blood flow drives the heart valve leaflets to open and close, the flow in the vicinity of the valve resembles a pulsed jet through a nonaxisymmetric orifice with a dynamically changing area. As a result, three-dimensional vortex rings with intricate topology emerge that interact with the complex cardiac anatomy and give rise to shear layers, regions of recirculation, and flow instabilities that could ultimately lead to transition to turbulence. Such complex flow patterns, which are inherently valve- and patient-specific, lead to mechanical forces at scales that can cause blood cell damage and thrombosis, increasing the likelihood of stroke, and can trigger the pathogenesis of various life-threatening valvular heart diseases. We summarize the current understanding of flow phenomena induced by heart valves, discuss their linkage with disease pathways, and emphasize the research advances required to translate in-depth understanding of valvular hemodynamics into effective patient therapies.},

  abstract = {Four molecular Non-Newtonian viscosity models plus the Newtonian one were analyzed for the normal human aorta under oscillating flow via: molecular viscosity, time Average Wall Shear Stress (AWSS), Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI) and Relative Residence Time (RRT). The capabilities of the applied non-Newtonian law models appear at low strain rates. The Newtonian blood flow treatment is considered to be a good approximation at mid-and high-strain rates. All blood flow models yield a consistent aorta pattern. High RRT values develop in the concave part of the aortic arch downstream to left subclavian artery. In this region the molecular viscosity is elevated, the WSS is low and the OSI is high. Concave aorta parts are prone to exhibit elevated RRT. The non-Newtonian Power Law blood flow model approximates the molecular viscosity, WSS, OSI and particularly the RRT in a more satisfactory way. High RRT distribution is emerging as an appropriate tool for identifying the possible regions of atheromatic concentrations.},

  abstract = {The art of modelling the physical world lies in the appropriate simplification and abstraction of the complete problem. In fluid mechanics, the NavierStokes equations provide a model that is valid under most circumstances germane to animal locomotion, but the complexity of solutions provides strong incentive for the development of further, more simplified practical models. When the flow organizes itself so that all shearing motions are collected into localized patches, then various mathematical vortex models have been very successful in predicting and furthering the physical understanding of many flows, particularly in aerodynamics. Experimental models have the significant added convenience that the fluid mechanics can be generated by a real fluid, not a model, provided the appropriate dimensionless groups have similar values. Then, analogous problems can be encountered in making intelligible but independent descriptions of the experimental results. Finally, model predictions and experimental results may be compared if, and only if, numerical estimates of the likely variations in the tested quantities are provided. Examples from recent experimental measurements of wakes behind a fixed wing and behind a bird in free flight are used to illustrate these principles.},

To achieve the necessary regimes for the chosen validations, we develop, from a three-dimensional, axially-symmetric flow formulation, a novel, two-dimensional, pseudo Cartesian, MCLBE scheme. This requires the inclusion in lattice Boltzmann methodology of a continuously distributed source and a velocity-dependent force density (here, the metric force terms of the cylindrical Navier\textendash Stokes equations). Specifically, we apply our model to the problem of flow past a spherical liquid drop in Re = 0, Ca regime and, also, flow past a lightly deformed drop. The resulting simulation data, once corrected for the simulation's inter-facial micro-current (using a method we also advance herein, based on freezing the phase field) show good agreement with theory over a small range of density contrasts. In particular, our data extend verified compliance with the kinematic condition from flat (Burgin et al 2019 Phys. Rev. E 100 043310) to the case of curved fluid\textendash fluid interfaces. More generally, our results indicate a route to eliminate the influence of the inter-facial micro-current.},

The benefits of such a model are its transparent methodology, stability at high levels of deformation, automatic-adaptive interface, and potential for the simulation of many erythrocytes.

Since indications as well as limitations of therapies for those diseases are still subject of discussion, this project is aimed at the optimization and the finding of indication cri teria using a numerical simulation of the heart. The focus lies on the left ventricle, the atrium and the heart valves. In order to get quantitative information on the respective dis ease, it is first necessary to model a healthy human heart as a reference for a successful therapy planning. Standard clinical imaging (MRI, CT) is used to get a time-resolved ventricular geometry by segmentation of the fluid move ment. A semiautomatic method generates topologically identical grids of the ventricle for each trigger step. A new grid generation method for the atrium is presented. The heart movement for a full cardiac cycle is performed by a third order approximation during simulation. Former pub lications showed, that the intraventricular flow structure is not only prescribed by the ventricle itself, but also by the movement and shape of the atrium. Enhancements in mod eling the atrium and the valve models as well as an opti mized grid generation are presented.}

The tests were conducted in the NACA 24-inch high-speed wind tunnel. The flow photographs were obtained by the Schlieren method and the pressures were simultaneously measured for 54 stations in the 5-inch-chord airfoil by means of a multiple-tube manometer. Following the general program, a few measurements of total-pressure loss in the wake of the airfoil at high speeds were made to illustrate the magnitude of the losses involved and the extent of the disturbed region; and, finally, in order to relate this work to earlier force-test data, a force test of a 5-inch-chord NACA 4412 airfoil was made. The results show the general nature of the phenomenon known as the compressibility burble. The source of the increased drag is shown to be a compression shock that occurs on the airfoil as its speed approaches the speed of sound. Finally, it is indicated that considerable experimentation is needed in order to understand the phenomenon completely.},

We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System\textemdash biosphere, climate, and societies\textemdash and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

  abstract = {In earlier studies we found that the three-element windkessel, although an almost perfect load for isolated heart studies, does not lead to accurate estimates of total arterial compliance. To overcome this problem, we introduce an inertial term in parallel with the characteristic impedance. In seven dogs we found that ascending aortic pressure could be predicted better from aortic flow by using the four-element windkessel than by using the three-element windkessel: the root-mean-square errors and the Akaike information criterion and Schwarz criterion were smaller for the four-element windkessel. The three-element windkessel overestimated total arterial compliance compared with the values derived from the area and the pulse pressure method (P = 0.0047, pairedt-test), whereas the four-element windkessel compliance estimates were not different (P = 0.81). The characteristic impedance was underestimated using the three-element windkessel, whereas the four-element windkessel estimation differed marginally from the averaged impedance modulus at high frequencies (P = 0.0017 and 0.031, respectively). When applied to the human, the four-element windkessel also was more accurate in these same aspects. Using a distributed model of the systemic arterial tree, we found that the inertial term results from the proper summation of all local inertial terms, and we call it total arterial inertance. We conclude that the fourelement windkessel, with all its elements having a hemodynamic meaning, is superior to the three-element windkessel as a lumped-parameter model of the entire systemic tree or as a model for parameter estimation of vascular properties.},

Rapid release of the sample pore pressure at isothermal conditions between 242 and 271 K preserves up to 93\% of the hydrate for at least 24 h, reflecting the greatly suppressed rates of dissociation that characterize this regime. Subsequent warming through the H2O ice point then induces rapid and complete dissociation, allowing controlled recovery of the total expected gas yield. This behavior is in marked contrast to that exhibited by methane hydrate at both colder (193-240 K) and warmer (272- 290 K) test conditions, where dissociation rates increase monotonically with increasing temperature. Anomalous preservation has potential application for successful retrieval of natural gas hydrate or hydrate-bearing sediments from remote settings, as well as for temporary low-pressure transport and storage of natural gas.},

  abstract = {Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate grain texture and pore structure development within various compositions of pure sI and sII gas hydrates synthesized in the laboratory, as well as in natural samples retrieved from marine (Gulf of Mexico) and permafrost (NW Canada) settings. Several samples of methane hydrate were also quenched after various extents of partial reaction for assessment of mid-synthesis textural progression. All laboratory-synthesized hydrates were grown under relatively high-temperature and high-pressure conditions from rounded ice grains with geometrically simple pore shapes, yet all resulting samples displayed extensive recrystallization with complex pore geometry. Growth fronts of mesoporous methane hydrate advancing into dense ice reactant were prevalent in those samples quenched after limited reaction below and at the ice point. As temperatures transgress the ice point, grain surfaces continue to develop a discrete "rind" of hydrate, typically 5 to 30 gin thick. The cores then commonly melt, with rind microfracturing allowing migration of the melt to adjacent grain boundaries where it also forms hydrate. As the reaction continues under progressively warmer conditions, the hydrate product anneals to form dense and relatively pore-free regions of hydrate grains, in which grain size is typically several tens of micrometers. The prevalence of hollow, spheroidal shells of hydrate, coupled with extensive redistribution of reactant and product phases throughout reaction, implies that a diffusion-controlled shrinking-core model is an inappropriate description of sustained hydrate growth from melting ice. Completion of reaction at peak synthesis conditions then produces exceptional faceting and euhedral crystal growth along exposed pore walls. Further recrystallization or regrowth can then accompany even short-term exposure of synthetic hydrates to natural ocean-floor conditions, such that the final textures may closely mimic those observed in natural samples of marine origin. Of particular note, both the mesoporous and highly faceted textures seen at different stages during synthetic hydrate growth were notably absent from all examined hydrates recovered from a natural marine-environment setting.},

In this study, intraventricular flow in a patient-specific left ventricle has been modelled in two-dimension (2D) with both mitral and aortic valves integrated. The arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach was employed to handle the large mesh deformation induced by the beating ventricular wall and moving leaflets. Ventricular wall deformation was predefined based on MRI data, while leaflet dynamics were predicted numerically by fluid-structure interaction (FSI). Comparisons of simulation results with in vitro and in vivo measurements reported in the literature demonstrated that numerical method in combination with MRI was able to predict qualitatively the patient-specific intraventricular flow. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simulate patient-specific ventricular flow taking into account both mitral and aortic valves.}

This constitutive description couples a Newtonian stress/shear-rate relationship (where the local viscosity of the suspension is dependent on the local volume fraction of solids) with a shear-induced migration model of the suspended particles. The two-dimensional and three-dimensional (axisymmetric) model is benchmarked with a variety of single-phase and two-phase analytic solutions and experimental results. We describe new experimental results using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging to determine non-invasively the evolution of the solids-concentration profiles of initially well-mixed suspensions as they separate when subjected to slow flow between counter-rotating eccentric cylinders and to piston-driven flow in a pipe. We show good qualitative and quantitative agreement of the numerical predictions and the experimental measurements. These flows result in complex final distributions of the solids, causing rheological behaviour that cannot be accurately described with typical single-phase constitutive equations.},

The cost of ethanol production from lignocellulosic materials is relatively high based on current technologies, and the main challenges are the low yield and high cost of the hydrolysis process. Considerable research efforts have been made to improve the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials. Pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials to remove lignin and hemicellulose can significantly enhance the hydrolysis of cellulose. Optimization of the cellulase enzymes and the enzyme loading can also improve the hydrolysis. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation effectively removes glucose, which is an inhibitor to cellulase activity, thus increasing the yield and rate of cellulose hydrolysis.},

Although mouse models are commonly used in atherosclerosis studies, little is known about local variations in wall shear stress (WSS) in the mouse and whether the levels of WSS are comparable to those in humans. The objective of this study was to determine WSS values in the mouse aorta and to relate these to expression of gene products associated with atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using micro-CT and ultrasound methodologies we developed a computational fluid dynamics model of the mouse aorta and found values of WSS to be much larger than those for humans. We also used a quantum dot-based approach to study vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression on the aortic intima and demonstrated that increased expression for these molecules occurs where WSS was relatively low for the mouse. CONCLUSIONS: Despite large differences in WSS in the two species, the spatial distributions of atherogenic molecules in the mouse aorta are similar to atherosclerotic plaque localization found in human aortas. These results suggest that relative differences in WSS or in the direction of WSS, as opposed to the absolute magnitude, may be relevant determinants of flow-mediated inflammatory responses.},

Although they are often targeted for implanted tissue engineered organs or drug-delivery devices because of their highly integrated systems, microfluidic devices are usually powered by external energy sources and therefore difficult to be used in vivo. A microfluidic device powered without the need for external energy sources or stimuli is needed. Previously, we demonstrated the concept of a cardiomyocyte pump using only chemical energy input to cells as a driver (Yo Tanaka, Keisuke Morishima, Tatsuya Shimizu, Akihiko Kikuchi, Masayuki Yamato, Teruo Okano and Takehiko Kitamori, Lab Chip, 6(3), pp. 362-368). However, the structure of this prototype pump described there included complicated mechanical components and fabricated compartments. Here, we have created a micro-spherical heart-like pump powered by spontaneously contracting cardiomyocyte sheets driven without a need for external energy sources or coupled stimuli. This device was fabricated by wrapping a beating cardiomyocyte sheet exhibiting large contractile forces around a fabricated hollow elastomeric sphere (5 mm diameter, 250 [micro sign]m polymer thickness) fixed with inlet and outlet ports. Fluid oscillations in a capillary connected to the hollow sphere induced by the synchronously pulsating cardiomyocyte sheet were confirmed, and the device continually worked for at least 5 days in this system. This bio/artificial hybrid fluidic pump device is innovative not only because it is driven by cells using only chemical energy input, but also because the design is an optimum structure (sphere). We anticipate that this device might be applied for various purposes including a bio-actuator for medical implant devices that relies on biochemical energy, not electrical interfacing.},

A coordinate measuring machine was used to measure and digitize the coordinates of the left ventricle. From the complex measured left ventricle shape values, a three-dimensional finite volume representation was constructed using a simulation package. The left ventricular walls moved towards the centre of the aortic outlet in order to study the effects of time-varying left ventricular ejection. The left ventricular wall motion was assumed to follow the blood flow and the wall grid was reformed 25 times during the calculation. The 25.8 cm3 ventricular volume was reduced by 75\% in 0.25 s. Centreline and cross-sectional velocity vectors greatly increased in magnitude at the aortic outlet, and most of the pressure occurred in the top 15\% of the heart. The computational method should make it possible to compare simulation results with important measurement techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, and this should allow a finer detail of flow understanding than is presently available using either a modelling or imaging method alone.}

To address this possibility, we examined the extent to which Sans Forgetica, a newly developed font, improves memory performance \textendash{} as the creators of the font claim. Across four experiments, we set out to replicate unpublished findings by the font's creators. Subjects read information in Sans Forgetica or Arial, and rated how difficult the information was to read (Experiment 1) or attempted to recall the information (Experiments 2\textendash 4). Although subjects rated Sans Forgetica as being more difficult to read than Arial, Sans Forgetica led to equivalent memory performance, and sometimes even impaired it. These findings suggest that although Sans Forgetica promotes a feeling of disfluency, it does not create a desirable difficulty or benefit memory.},

Implementation of a two-layer mixing-length algebraic model and two versions of the k-{$\epsilon$} two-equation model, Standard and RNG, in conjunction with a wall model, are presented. Validation studies are done for turbulent flows in a straight pipe at three Re numbers and over a backwards facing step of expansion ratio 1.5 and ReH=44\,000. All models produce good agreement with experiment for the straight pipes but the RNG k-{$\epsilon$} model is best able to capture both the recirculation length, within 2\% of experiment, and the detailed structure of the mean fluid flow for the backwards facing step.}

Simulation of blood flow in the arterial network system will provide a better understanding of the physiology of human body. Hence, hemodynamics play an important role in the development and progression of arterial stenosis, leading to the malfunctioning of cardiovascular system. Simulation studies of blood flow in the diseased condition can diagonise the health problem easily and also have many applications in the areas such as surgical planning and design of medical devices. This paper presents a review on the existing scenario of the simulation studies of blood flow, starting with a brief overview of the structure and function of arteries and veins followed by a discussion on pressure wave propagation, blood flow models and Fluid Structure Interaction in the arterial system.},

Secondly, the physics of wave propagation and reflection in a domain is investigated in a coupled simulation, and compared to the solutions obtained in both a pure free-surface and a pure shallow-water simulation. Finally, a performance test is carried out to demonstrate that the overhead of the coupling is negligible. A quantitative validation of this type of coupling for the lattice Boltzmann method is novel, and opens the door to a range of large-scale simulations of canals and other hydrodynamic systems.},

Previous investigations, however, are limited by a lack of understanding of the focal association between WSS and CAD progression (i.e., data are notably spatially averaged). Thus, the aim of this investigation was to examine the focal association between WSS and coronary atherosclerosis progression, and compare these results to those determined by spatial averaging. Five patients with CAD underwent baseline and 6-month follow-up angiographic and virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound imaging to quantify CAD progression. Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models were constructed to compute baseline WSS values, which were either averaged around the entire artery circumference or examined in focal regions (sectors). Analysis of data within each sector (n = 3871) indicated that circumferentially averaged and sector WSS values were statistically different (p {$<$} 0.05) and exhibited poor agreement (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.69). Furthermore, differences were observed between the analysis techniques when examining the association of WSS and CAD progression. This investigation highlights the importance of examining spatially heterogeneous variables at a focal level to reduce the affect of data reduction and warrants implementation in a larger clinical study to determine the predictive power in prospectively identifying rapidly progressing and/or vulnerable coronary plaques.},

Clathrates were found to form within the center of pore spaces, rather than on grain surfaces. Cementation of grains only occurred in regions of a small grain size, or where a large proportion of pore space was filled with hydrate. However, even at high clathrate saturations, a thin film of free water persisted on grain surfaces. The results have important implications for the potential cementing effect of hydrates on sediments, and thus for sediment permeability, slope stability, and seismic interpretation of hydrate-bearing sediments.},

However, there are concerns with respect to the integrity of seals in subsurface storage of CO(2) and the risks associated with leakage to ocean and atmosphere. In this paper, we report the results of experimental laboratory simulation of CO(2) leakage from subsurface storage sites and the self-sealing mechanism of CO(2) hydrates in subsea sediments, using an experimental setup specifically constructed for this work. The results demonstrate that the sequestrated CO(2) migrated upward and formed hydrates with the pore water in the sediment when the pressure and temperature conditions in the sediments were inside the hydrate stability zone. The CO(2) hydrate formation slowed down the CO(2) diffusion rate by several times to 3 orders of magnitude. The upward migrating CO(2) tended to form hydrate at the base of the hydrate stability zone. On the geological time scale the CO(2) hydrate formation could create a low-permeability secondary cap layer which greatly restricts further upward CO(2) flow, should a leakage occurs. This potential "self-sealing" and "self-healing" process could be an important criterion in the selection of suitable sites for geological storage of CO(2).},

That is why understanding and correct mathematical description of RBCs behavior in blood is a critical step in modelling the blood dynamics. Various phenomena provided by RBCs such as aggregation, deformation, shear-induced diffusion and non-uniform radial distribution affect the passage of blood through the vessels. Hence, they have to be taken into account while modelling the blood dynamics. Other important blood corpuscles are platelets, which are crucial for blood clotting. RBCs strongly affect the platelet transport in blood expelling them to the vessel walls and increasing their dispersion, which has to be considered in models of clotting. In this article we give a brief review of basic modern approaches in mathematical description of these phenomena, discuss their applicability to real flow conditions and propose further pathways for developing the theory of blood flow.},

The platelet hemostatic function involves the direct interaction with damaged vessel walls, and circulating coagulation factors, primarily thrombin resulting in platelet activation, aggregation and formation of hemostatic plug. Flow cytometry is a useful technique for the study of platelet activation in circulating blood. Platelet activation markers for ex vivo analysis may include a) activation-dependent epitopes of the membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa (CD41a) receptor, as demonstrated by the binding of activation- specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) PAC1, anti-LIBS1 and anti-RIBS); b) the expression of P-selectin (CD62p), the \textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\}{$f\lbrace$}\AE\vphantom\{\}'\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\}\{\textbackslash ldots\}\textbackslash\^A\vphantom\{\}{$\frac{1}{2}\backslash$}\~A\vphantom\{\}{$f\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\lbrace\backslash$}\^a\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\texteuro\v{s}\textbackslash\~A\vphantom\{\},\textbackslash\^A\vphantom\{\}{$\pm$}-granule GP translocated to the platelet surface following release reaction; and c) platelet procoagulant activity, as demonstrated by the binding of i) annexin V protein to the prothrombinase-complex (prothrombin, activated factor X (Xa) and V (Va)) binding sites on the surface of activated platelets, and of ii) MoAbs against activated coagulation factors V and X bound to the surface of activated platelets. Using this method, platelet activation as a marker for in vivo prothrombotic activity can be demonstrated in various clinical conditions including coronary angioplasty, orthostatic challenge in primary depression, sickle cell disease in clinical remission and during pain episode, and in pregnancy- related hypertension with marked increase during preeclampsia. The finding of platelet procoagulant activity is corroborated by increased levels of plasma markers for thrombin generation and fibrinolytic activity. (J Biol Regul Homeost Agents 2004; 18: 172-7)}

The blood near the apex of an aneurysm is likely to be stagnant, which causes very low wall shear stress and is a factor in rupture by degrading the aneurysmal wall. In this study, however, relatively high flow velocities due to the interaction between the blood flow and aneurysmal wall are seen to be independent of the wall model. The present results indicate that both linearly elastic and hyper-elastic models can be useful to investigate aneurysm FSI.},

Nevertheless a thorough understanding of the biomechanics near abdominal side branches in mice is lacking. In the current work we present a mouse-specific fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) model of the abdominal aorta in ApoE-/- mice that incorporates in vivo stresses. The aortic geometry was based on contrast-enhanced in vivo micro-CT images, while aortic flow boundary conditions and material model parameters were based on in vivo high-frequency ultrasound. Flow waveforms predicted by FSI simulations corresponded better to in vivo measurements than those from CFD simulations. Peak-systolic principal stresses at the inner and outer aortic wall were locally increased caudal to the celiac and left lateral to the celiac and mesenteric arteries. Interestingly, these were also the locations at which a tear in the tunica media had been observed in previous work on angiotensin II-infused mice. Our preliminary results therefore suggest that local biomechanics play an important role in the pathophysiology of branch-related ruptures in angiotensin-II infused mice. More elaborate follow-up research is needed to demonstrate the role of biomechanics and mechanobiology in a longitudinal setting.},

A CT scan for one patient was used to create one in vivo tricuspid aortic valve geometry and assessed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). CFD simulated the pressure, velocity, and flow rate, which were used to assess the Gorlin formula and continuity equation, current clinical diagnostic standards. The results demonstrate an underestimation of the anatomic orifice area (AOA) by Gorlin formula and overestimation of AOA by the continuity equation, using peak velocities, as would be measured clinically by Doppler echocardiography. As a result, we suggest that the Gorlin formula is unable to achieve the intended estimation of AOA and largely underestimates AOA at the critical low-flow states present in heart failure. The disparity in the use of echocardiography with the continuity equation is due to the variation in velocity profile between the outflow tract and the valve orifice. Comparison of time-averaged orifice areas by Gorlin and continuity with instantaneous orifice areas by planimetry can mask the errors of these methods, which is a result of the assumption that the blood flow is inviscid.},

For the pulsatile case, a predictor-corrector time marching scheme is used with an adaptive time step. Results are obtained for steady and pulsatile physiological flows.

The disturbances are stronger by their vorticity intensity and persist after the geometrical obstacle. This is especially true for severe stenoses.},

This study assessed the systolic myocardial shortening properties of the long axis (LA) and short axis (SA) of the LV as determined from pulsed Doppler tissue imaging in two groups of patients with similar degrees of LV dysfunction and similar LV sphericity: patients with IVNC and patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). METHODS: Pulsed Doppler tissue imaging was used to record systolic myocardial velocities along the LA and SA of the LV in a group with IVNC (n = 13) and a group with DCMP (n = 13). The groups were matched for mean extent of LV dysfunction and mean sphericity index. In all 26 patients, the systolic myocardial velocity pattern for each axis featured two distinct peaks (SW1 and SW2). These peak velocities and the intervals from the electrocardiographic Q wave to each peak (Q-SW1, Q-SW2) were recorded for each axis, and group means were calculated and statistically compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the IVNC and DCMP groups with respect to any of the pulsed Doppler tissue imaging variables. Concerning the data for SW1 and SW2, intragroup comparisons revealed no significant differences in either group. In each of the two groups, LA-Q-SW1 was significantly shorter than LA-Q-SW2, SA-Q-SW1, and SA-Q-SW2. Each group's LA-Q-SW2 and SA-Q-SW2 values were also statistically similar. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that, given comparable degrees of spheric remodeling and comparable LV dysfunction, patients with IVNC and patients with DCMP show similar contraction properties along the LA and SA of the LV.}

The diffuser configurations were computationally and experimentally investigated for ftow rates of 2-10 L/min at rotational speeds of 50008000 rpm. For these operating conditions.

  abstract = {Modelling blood flow in microvascular networks is challenging due to the complex nature of haemorheology. Zero- and one-dimensional approaches cannot reproduce local haemodynamics, and models that consider individual red blood cells (RBCs) are prohibitively computationally expensive. Continuum approaches could provide an efficient solution, but dependence on a large parameter space and scarcity of experimental data for validation has limited their application. We describe a method to assimilate experimental RBC velocity and concentration data into a continuum numerical modelling framework. Imaging data of RBCs were acquired in a sequentially bifurcating microchannel for various flow conditions. RBC concentration distributions were evaluated and mapped into computational fluid dynamics simulations with rheology prescribed by the Quemada model. Predicted velocities were compared to particle image velocimetry data. A subset of cases was used for parameter optimisation, and the resulting model was applied to a wider data set to evaluate model efficacy. The pre-optimised model reduced errors in predicted velocity by 60\% compared to assuming a Newtonian fluid, and optimisation further reduced errors by 40\%. Asymmetry of RBC velocity and concentration profiles was demonstrated to play a critical role. Excluding asymmetry in the RBC concentration doubled the error, but excluding spatial distributions of shear rate had little effect. This study demonstrates that a continuum model with optimised rheological parameters can reproduce measured velocity if RBC concentration distributions are known a priori. Developing this approach for RBC transport with more network configurations has the potential to provide an efficient approach for modelling network-scale haemodynamics. \textcopyright{} 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Mice are widely used to investigate atherogenesis, which is known to be influenced by stresses related to blood flow. However, numerical characterization of the haemodynamic environment in the commonly studied aortic arch has hitherto been based on idealizations of inflow into the aorta. Our purpose in this work was to numerically characterize the haemodynamic environment in the mouse aortic arch using measured inflow velocities, and to relate the resulting shear stress patterns to known locations of high- and low-lesion prevalence. Blood flow velocities were measured in the aortic root of C57/BL6 mice using phase-contrast MRI. Arterial geometries were obtained by micro-CT of corrosion casts. These data were used to compute blood flow and wall shear stress (WSS) patterns in the arch. WSS profiles computed using realistic and idealized aortic root velocities differed significantly. An unexpected finding was that average WSS in the high-lesion-probability region on the inner wall was actually higher than the WSS in the low-probability region on the outer wall. Future studies of mouse aortic arch haemodynamics should avoid the use of idealized inflow velocity profiles. Lesion formation does not seem to uniquely associate with low or oscillating WSS in this segment, suggesting that other factors may also play a role in lesion localization.},

  abstract = {Fluid structure interaction computations in geometries where different chambers are almost completely separated from each other by amovable rigid body but connected through very small gaps can encounter stability problems when a standard explicit coupling procedure is used for the coupling of the fluid flow and the movement of the rigid body. An example of such kind of flows is the opening and closing of valves when the valve motion is driven by the flow. In this paper a stability analysis is performed for the coupling procedure of the movement of a cylinder in a cylindrical tube filled with fluid. Between the moving cylinder and the tube a small gap is present so that two chambers are formed. It is shown that a standard explicit coupling procedure or an implicit coupling procedure with explicit coupling in the subiterations steps can lead to unstable motion depending on the size of the gaps the density of the rigid body and the density of the fluid. It is proven that a reduction of the time step size cannot stabilize the coupling procedure. An implicit coupling procedure with implicit coupling in the subiterations has to be used. An illustration is given on how such a coupling procedure can be implemented in a commercial CFD software package. The CFD package Fluent Fluent Inc. is used. As an application the opening and the closing of a prosthetic aortic valve is computed.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) leads to variable stress for the left ventricle (LV) and consequently a broad range of LV remodeling. The aim of this study was to describe blood flow patterns in the ascending aorta of patients with AS and determine their association with remodeling.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients with AS (14 mild, 8 moderate, 15 severe; age, 63{$\pm$}13 years) and 37 healthy controls (age, 60{$\pm$}10 years) underwent 4-dimensional-flow magnetic resonance imaging. Helical and vortical flow formations and flow eccentricity were assessed in the ascending aorta. Normalized flow displacement from the vessel center and peak systolic wall shear stress in the ascending aorta were quantified. LV remodeling was assessed based on LV mass index and the ratio of LV mass:end-diastolic volume (relative wall mass). Marked helical and vortical flow formation and eccentricity were more prevalent in patients with AS than in healthy subjects, and patients with AS exhibited an asymmetrical and elevated distribution of peak systolic wall shear stress. In AS, aortic orifice area was strongly negatively associated with vortical flow formation (P=0.0274), eccentricity (P=0.0070), and flow displacement (P=0.0021). Bicuspid aortic valve was associated with more intense helical (P=0.0098) and vortical flow formation (P=0.0536), higher flow displacement (P=0.11), and higher peak systolic wall shear stress (P=0.0926). LV mass index and relative wall mass were significantly associated with aortic orifice area (P=0.0611, P=0.0058) and flow displacement (P=0.0058, P=0.0283).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, AS leads to abnormal blood flow pattern and peak systolic wall shear stress in the ascending aorta. In addition to aortic orifice area, normalized flow displacement was significantly associated with LV remodeling.},

Our compressional wave speed measurements through partially water-saturated, methane hydrate-bearing Ottawa sands suggest hydrate surrounds and cements sediment grains. The three Ottawa sand packs tested in the Gas Hydrate And Sediment Test Laboratory Instrument (GHASTLI) contain 38(1)\% porosity, initially with distilled water saturating 58, 31, and 16\% of that pore space, respectively. From the volume of methane gas produced during hydrate dissociation, we calculated the hydrate concentration in the pore space to be 70, 37, and 20\% respectively. Based on these hydrate concentrations and our measured compressional wave speeds, we used a rock physics model to differentiate between potential pore-space hydrate distributions. Model results suggest methane hydrate cements unconsolidated sediment when forming in systems containing an abundant gas phase.},

Physical properties include thermal properties, permeability, electrical conductivity and permittivity, small-strain elastic P and S wave velocities, shear strength, and volume changes resulting from hydrate dissociation.

  abstract = {An eddy-viscosity turbulence model employing three additional transport equations is presented and applied to a number of transitional flow test cases. The model is based on the k-\$\o mega\$ framework and represents a substantial refinement to a transition-sensitive model that has been previously documented in the open literature. The third transport equation is included to predict the magnitude of low-frequency velocity fluctuations in the pretransitional boundary layer that have been identified as the precursors to transition. The closure of model terms is based on a phenomenological (i.e., physics-based) rather than a purely empirical approach and the rationale for the forms of these terms is discussed. The model has been implemented into a commercial computational fluid dynamics code and applied to a number of relevant test cases, including flat plate boundary layers with and without applied pressure gradients, as well as a variety of airfoil test cases with different geometries, Reynolds numbers, freestream turbulence conditions, and angles of attack. The test cases demonstrate the ability of the model to successfully reproduce transitional flow behavior with a reasonable degree of accuracy, particularly in comparison with commonly used models that exhibit no capability of predicting laminar-to-turbulent boundary layer development. While it is impossible to resolve all of the complex features of transitional and turbulent flows with a relatively simple Reynolds-averaged modeling approach, the results shown here demonstrate that the new model can provide a useful and practical tool for engineers addressing the simulation and prediction of transitional flow behavior in fluid systems.},

The non-Newtonian effect and the nonlinearity of slip velocity against wall shear stress were described using a slip model. The true viscosity of a concentrated suspension with glass powder suspended in a non-Newtonian binder system was calculated as a function of shear rate and effective particle concentration, taking into consideration particle migration, which is calculated by a diffusive numerical model. Particle size was found to affect significantly the viscosity of the suspension with viscosity decreasing with increasing particle size, which can be reflected by a decrease in the value of the power-law index in the Krieger model. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2010},

To determine the soil-freezing characteristic, we simultaneously measured liquid water content and relative permittivity of various unsaturated soils at above-zero and subzero temperatures by using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and time-domain reflectometry (TDR). The dielectric permittivity of frozen soil decreased with a decrease in temperature, which was accompanied by a decrease in liquid (unfrozen) water content. Frozen soils with different total water content had the same amount of unfrozen water at below -\dbend 1\dbend\dbend C; however, the permittivity of frozen soil depended on the total water content. A dielectric mixing model without considering reduced dielectric permittivity due to surface forces and ice formation could only describe the data for sandy soils. We expanded the mixing model by including reduced dielectric permittivity due to surface forces and ice formation. The estimations of liquid water content using the expanded mixing model were in agreement with the values measured by NMR at any soil type, total water content, ice content, and temperature.},

The EEP was calculated for each beat for 1 minute at both the proximal end of the pump outlet cannula and at the distal end (arterial EEP). Nominal mean fiowrates were 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, and 1.25 I/min. Systolic duration was set at either 230 or 400 milliseconds. With a rapid systolic ejection (230 milliseconds), the arterial EEP ranged from 5.58\% to 8.41 \% relative to the mean arterial pressure. The highest EEP occurred at the lowest fiowrate. With a slower (400 milliseconds) systolic ejection, the arterial EEP ranged from 2.33\% to 4.20\%. Hemodynamic energy loss in the outlet cannula was also quantified by the differential EEP and shown to increase markedly as systolic duration was decreased, but was relatively insensitive to mean fiowrate.

It explained aortic pressure decay in diastole, but fell short in systole. Therefore characteristic impedance was introduced as a third element of the Windkessel model. Characteristic impedance links the lumped Windkessel to transmission phenomena (e.g., wave travel). Windkessels are used as hydraulic load for isolated hearts and in studies of the entire circulation. Furthermore, they are used to estimate total arterial compliance from pressure and flow; several of these methods are reviewed. Windkessels describe the general features of the input impedance, with physiologically interpretable parameters. Since it is a lumped model it is not suitable for the assessment of spatially distributed phenomena and aspects of wave travel, but it is a simple and fairly accurate approximation of ventricular afterload.},

These measurements show that hydrate increases shear strength and p-wave velocity in natural and reconstituted samples. The proportion of this increase depends on (1) the amount and distribution of hydrate present, (2) differences in sediment properties, and (3) differences in test conditions. Stress-strain curves from the Mallik samples suggest that natural gas hydrate does not cement sediment grains. However, stress-strain curves from the Ottawa sand (containing laboratory-formed gas hydrate) do imply cementation is present. Acoustically, rock physics modeling shows that gas hydrate does not cement grains of natural Mackenzie Delta sediment. Natural gas hydrates are best modeled as part of the sediment frame. This finding is in contrast with direct observations and results of Ottawa sand containing laboratory-formed hydrate, which was found to cement grains (Waite et al. 2004). It therefore appears that the microscopic distribution of gas hydrates in sediment, and hence the effect of gas hydrate on sediment physical properties, differs between natural deposits and laboratory-formed samples. This difference may possibly be caused by the location of water molecules that are available to form hydrate. Models that use laboratory-derived properties to predict behavior of natural gas hydrate must account for these differences.},

  abstract = {Cardiac dysfunction constitutes common cardiovascular health issues in the society, and has been an investigation topic of strong focus by researchers in the medical imaging community. Diagnostic modalities based on echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, chest radiography and computed tomography are common techniques that provide cardiovascular structural information to diagnose heart defects. However, functional information of cardiovascular flow, which can in fact be used to support the diagnosis of many cardiovascular diseases with a myriad of hemodynamics performance indicators, remains unexplored to its full potential. Some of these indicators constitute important cardiac functional parameters affecting the cardiovascular abnormalities. With the advancement of computer technology that facilitates high speed computational fluid dynamics, the realization of a support diagnostic platform of hemodynamics quantification and analysis can be achieved. This article reviews the state-of-the-art medical imaging and high fidelity multi-physics computational analyses that together enable reconstruction of cardiovascular structures and hemodynamic flow patterns within them, such as of the left ventricle (LV) and carotid bifurcations. The combined medical imaging and hemodynamic analysis enables us to study the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease-causing dysfunctions, such as how (1) cardiomyopathy causes left ventricular remodeling and loss of contractility leading to heart failure, and (2) modeling of LV construction and simulation of intra-LV hemodynamics can enable us to determine the optimum procedure of surgical ventriculation to restore its contractility and health This combined medical imaging and hemodynamics framework can potentially extend medical knowledge of cardiovascular defects and associated hemodynamic behavior and their surgical restoration, by means of an integrated medical image diagnostics and hemodynamic performance analysis framework.},

To better understand TAVR performance, a fluid\textendash structure interaction (FSI) model of a self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve was proposed. After an in vitro durability experiment was done to test the valve, the FSI model was built to reproduce the experimental test. Lastly, the FSI model was used to simulate the virtual implant and performance in a patient-specific case. Results showed that the leaflet opening area during the cycle was similar to that of the in vitro test and the difference of the maximum leaflet opening between the two methodologies was of 0.42\%. Furthermore, the FSI simulation quantified the pressure and velocity fields. The computed strain amplitudes in the stent frame showed that this distribution in the patient-specific case is highly affected by the aortic root anatomy, suggesting that the in vitro tests that follow standards might not be representative of the real behavior of the percutaneous valve. The patient-specific case also compared in vivo literature data on fast opening and closing characteristics of the aortic valve during systolic ejection. FSI simulations represent useful tools in determining design errors or optimization potentials before the fabrication of aortic valve prototypes and the performance of tests.},

In order to test the coupling characteristics of the IBM with the multiple-relaxation-time LBM (MRT-LBM), the three-dimensional (3D) balloon dynamics, including inflation, release and breach processes, are simulated. In this paper, some key issues in the coupling scheme, including the discretization of 3D boundary surfaces, the calculation of boundary force density, and the introduction of external force into the LBM, are described. The good volume conservation and pressure retention properties are verified by two 3D cases. Finally, the three FSI processes of a 3D balloon dynamics are simulated. The large boundary deformation and oscillation, obvious elastic wave propagation, sudden stress release at free edge, and recoil phenomena are all observed. It is evident that the coupling scheme of the IBM and MRT-LBM can handle complicated 3D FSI problems involving large deformation and large pressure gradients with very good accuracy and stability.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

A computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation incorporating the constitutive model was implemented using OpenFOAM\textregistered{} in which benchmark problems including a sudden expansion and various driven slots and crevices were studied numerically.

  abstract = {The near-wall enrichment of platelets strongly influences thrombus formation in vivo and in vitro. This paper develops a multi-constituent continuum approach to study this phenomenon. A mixture theory model is used to describe the motion of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) and the interactions between the two components. A transport model is developed to study the influence of the RBCs field on the platelets. The model is used to study blood flow in a rectangular micro-channel, a sudden expansion micro-channel, and a channel containing micro crevices (representing a practical problem encountered in most blood-wetted devices). The simulations show that in the rectangular channel the concentration of the platelets near the walls is about five times higher than the concentration near the channel centerline. It is also noticed that in the channel with crevices, a large number of platelets accumulate in the deep part of the crevices and this may serve as nidus for excessive thrombus formation occurring in medical devices.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical simulation of blood flow in two aneurysmal vessels. Using a multicomponent continuum approach, called mixture theory, the velocity fields and spatial distribution of the red blood cells (RBCs) and the plasma are predicted. Platelet migration is described by a convection-diffusion equation, coupled to the RBC concentration field. The model is applied to study a two-dimensional straight vessel and multiple two-dimensional aneurysm vessels with different neck sizes. The model accurately predicts the enrichment of the platelets near the wall in the straight vessel, agreeing with the experimental measurement quantitatively. The numerical results also show that the near-wall enrichment of the platelets in the parent vessel highly influences the platelet concentration within the aneurysm. The results also indicate that the platelet concentration within the aneurysm increases with Reynolds number and decreases with a smaller neck size. This might have significance on the formation of thrombus (blood clot) within the aneurysm, which in turn may have a protective effect on preventing ruptures. Based on the success with the problems studied, we believe the current model can be a useful tool for analyzing the blood flow and platelets transport within patient specific aneurysms in the future.},

  abstract = {Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is associated with high mortality rates. Risk of rupture is multi-factorial involving AAA geometric configuration, vessel tortuosity, and the presence of intraluminal pathology. Fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulations were conducted in patient based computed tomography scans reconstructed geometries in order to monitor aneurysmal disease progression from normal aortas to non-ruptured and contained ruptured AAA (rAAA), and the AAA risk of rupture was assessed. Three groups of 8 subjects each were studied: 8 normal and 16 pathological (8 non-ruptured and 8 rAAA). The AAA anatomical structures segmented included the blood lumen, intraluminal thrombus (ILT), vessel wall, and embedded calcifications. The vessel wall was described with anisotropic material model that was matched to experimental measurements of AAA tissue specimens. A statistical model for estimating the local wall strength distribution was employed to generate a map of a rupture potential index (RPI), representing the ratio between the local stress and local strength distribution. The FSI simulations followed a clear trend of increasing wall stresses from normal to pathological cases. The maximal stresses were observed in the areas where the ILT was not present, indicating a potential protective effect of the ILT. Statistically significant differences were observed between the peak systolic stress and the peak stress at the mean arterial pressure between the three groups. For the ruptured aneurysms, where the geometry of intact aneurysm was reconstructed, results of the FSI simulations clearly depicted maximum wall stress at the a priori known location of rupture. The RPI mapping indicated several distinct regions of high RPI coinciding with the actual location of rupture. The FSI methodology demonstrates that the aneurysmal disease can be described by numerical simulations, as indicated by a clear trend of increasing aortic wall stresses in the studied groups, (normal aortas, AAAs and rAAAs). Ultimately, the results demonstrate that FSI wall stress mapping and RPI can be used as a tool for predicting the potential rupture of an AAA by predicting the actual rupture location, complementing current clinical practice by offering a predictive diagnostic tool for deciding whether to intervene surgically or spare the patient from an unnecessary risky operation.},

The changes may result from varying pressure or temperature at the seafloor, exploration and exploitation operations, rapid sedimentation or wasting at the seafloor, etc. Pressure and temperature may not be used as independent state variables at the same time to specify the overall state of such dynamic systems. Consequently, a pressure-enthalpy-gas concentration-salinity phase balance model is constructed for calculating phase distribution and transition of the system of marine gas hydrate, which is assumed to contain a liquid phase consisting of water, gas, and salt, a vapor phase consisting of gas only, solid halite, and solid gas hydrate consisting of gas and water. Calculations of phase transition processes demonstrate various dynamic feedback mechanisms involved in dynamically evolving marine gas-hydrate systems. A comprehensive model of fluid flow and transport of heat, water, salt, and gas in marine sediment is developed. Simulations show that gas hydrate dissociation resulting from increasing temperature or decreasing pressure at the seafloor may lead to the development of a three-phase zone with coexistent gas hydrate, free gas, and liquid solution and excess pore pressure in marine gas hydrate systems. The changes considered in this study are rapid ({$<$}10(5) years) with respect to the geological time scale but are sufficiently slow ({$>$}10(-2) years) to allow thermodynamic equilibrium throughout. The applicable pressure, temperature, and salinity ranges for the calculations used in this study are sufficiently wide to cover those likely occurring in gas hydrate-bearing marine sediments.},

  abstract = {Objective Various types of rotary blood pumps (axial flow, centrifugal) have been introduced into clinical use recently. These pumps have different pressure\textendash flow characteristics, and some investigators have noted that a limited pump flow rate and less pulsatility are the problems with the axial flow devices. Methods A new implantable centrifugal blood pump was developed that has an extremely flat pressure\textendash flow curve and is able to produce a significantly high pump flow rate of 20 l/min at a low pressure of 10\textendash 30 mmHg. When the pressure difference between the left ventricle and aorta decreases during systole, an instant high peak flow is achieved, which results in a higher peak pressure in the aorta (systolic pressure). During the diastolic phase, the left ventricle\textendash aorta pressure difference increases to maximum, and the pump flow rate decreases to minimum. Thus, the pump flow rate becomes completely pulsatile, and the high peak flow provides a higher mean pump flow rate. This pump was applied to two end-stage heart failure patients (dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV, inotrope-dependent). Results The pump was observed to provide completely pulsatile high flow assistance of 6\textendash 9 l/min with a constant pump speed. Both patients are currently in NYHA class I after 1 year on the device with no major adverse events. Conclusion The new centrifugal blood pump provides completely pulsatile high-flow circulatory support with a constant pump speed, which solves the current clinical problems with rotary blood pumps.}

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in model development, calibration, uncertainty analysis, scenario analysis, and, hence, decision making. With the availability of different sensitivity analysis techniques, selecting an appropriate technique, monitoring the convergence and estimating the uncertainty of the sensitivity indices are very crucial for environmental modelling, especially for distributed models due to their high non-linearity, non-monotonicity, highly correlated parameters, and intensive computational requirements. It would be useful to identify whether some techniques outperform others with respect to computational requirements, reliability, and other criteria. This paper proposes two methods to monitor the convergence and estimate the uncertainty of sensitivity analysis techniques. One is based on the central limit theorem and the other on the bootstrap technique. These two methods are implemented to assess five different sensitivity analysis techniques applied to an environmental model. These techniques are: the Sobol' method, the Morris method, Linear Regression (LR), Regionalized Sensitivity Analysis (RSA), and non-parametric smoothing. The results show that: (i) the Sobol' method is very robust in quantifying sensitivities and ranking parameters despite a large number of model evaluations; (ii) the Morris method is efficient to rank out unimportant parameters at a medium cost; (iii) the non-parametric smoothing is reliable and robust in quantifying the main effects and low-order interactions while requiring a small number of model evaluations; finally (iv) the other two techniques, that is, LR and RSA, should be used with care.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) within the left ventricle (LV) of healthy subjects using novel 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods and to compare TKE values to those from a limited group of patients with a spectrum of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 4D flow and morphological MRI data were acquired in 11 healthy subjects and 9 patients with different degrees of diastolic dysfunction. TKELV was calculated within the LV at each diastolic timeframe. At peak early (E) and late (A) diastolic filling, the TKELV was compared to transmitral peak velocity, LV diameter, and mitral annular diameter.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: In the majority of subjects, TKELV peaks were observed at E and A. Peak TKELV at E was not different between the groups (P = 0.33), and correlated with mitral annular dimensions (r(2) = 0.32, P = 0.01). Peak TKELV at A was higher in DCM patients compared to healthy subjects (3.0 {$\pm$} 1.8 vs. 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.8 mJ, P = 0.02), and correlated with LV diameter and transmitral velocity (r(2) = 0.36, P = 0.01 and r(2) = 0.47, P {$<$} 0.01, respectively).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: In LVs of healthy subjects, TKE values are low. Values are highest during early diastole, and diminish with increasing LV size. In a heterogeneous group of DCM patients, late diastolic TKE values are higher than in healthy subjects.J. Magn. Reson.

The requirements for nucleation can significantly delay the onset of hydrate formation when CH4-bearing liquids rise into the hydrate stability zone. Hydrate may not form at all if the vertical extent of the stability zone is too narrow to achieve sufficient cooling below equilibrium temperature. This is particular relevent in shallow water or at times in the Earth's past where the ocean floor was warmer than today.},

  abstract = {The non-slip boundary condition at solid walls cannot be accurately achieved by the conventional immersed boundary\textendash lattice Boltzmann (IB\textendash LB) coupling schemes due to insufficient interpolation accuracy. To solve this problem, an iterative force correction procedure for the IB\textendash LB coupling scheme is proposed. Cheng's external forcing term in the LB equation is selected to properly incorporate the present and the next time step effects. The unknown IB force and the corresponding force on fluid at the next time step are calculated by iterative correction, based on the known immersed boundary speed, flow velocity, and the relationship between the IB speed and the IB force. Instead of the Dirac delta function, the Lagrange interpolation polynomial is used to obtain the IB speed from nearby fluid velocity. Typical cases, including the flow around a circular cylinder, shearing flow near a non-slip wall, and circular Couette flow between two inversely rotating cylinders, are simulated to verify and validate the method. It is shown that the present method guarantees the non-slip boundary condition and maintain the overall first-order spatial convergence rate of the conventional immersed boundary method (IBM). The accuracy improvement is obvious for both stationary and moving solid boundaries in both viscous flows and strong shearing flows. To demonstrate application possibility, a mechanical heart valve flow is also simulated, and better agreements with experimental data are achieved compared to those by commercial software.}

Two types of flow environments are investigated: a suspension undergoing a bulk shear motion and a suspension flowing in a microchannel or duct. In a cellular suspension undergoing bulk shear deformation, the cross-flow migration of particles is diffusional. The velocity fluctuations in the suspension, which are the root cause of particle migration, are analyzed in detail, including their magnitude, the autocorrelation of Lagrangian tracer points and particles, and the associated integral time scales. The orientation and morphology of red blood cells vary with the shear rate, and these in turn cause the dimensionless particle diffusivity to vary non-monotonically with the flow capillary number. By simulating RBCs and platelets flowing in a microchannel of 34 {$\mu$} m height, we demonstrate that the velocity fluctuations in the core cellular flow region cause the platelets to migrate diffusively in the wall normal direction. A mean lateral velocity of particles, which is most significant near the edge of the cell-free layer, further expels them toward the wall, leading to their excess concentration in the cell-free layer. The calculated shear-induced particle diffusivity in the cell-laden region is in qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements of micron-sized beads in a cylindrical tube of a comparable diameter. In a smaller duct of 10\texttimes 15 {$\mu$} m cross section, the volume exclusion becomes the dominant mechanism for particle margination, which occurs at a much shorter time scale than the migration in the bigger channel.},

  abstract = {The difference between the rate of change of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) following stimulation is thought to be due to circumferential stress relaxation in veins (Mandeville, J.B., Marota, J.J.A., Ayata, C., Zaharchuk, G., Moskowitz, M.A., Rosen, B.R., Weisskoff, R.M., 1999. Evidence of a cerebrovascular postarteriole windkessel with delayed compliance. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 19, 679-689). In this paper we explore the visco-elastic properties of blood vessels, and present a dynamic model relating changes in CBF to changes in CBV. We refer to this model as the visco-elastic windkessel (VW) model. A novel feature of this model is that the parameter characterising the pressure-volume relationship of blood vessels is treated as a state variable dependent on the rate of change of CBV, producing hysteresis in the pressure-volume space during vessel dilation and contraction. The VW model is nonlinear time-invariant, and is able to predict the observed differences between the time series of CBV and that of CBF measurements following changes in neural activity. Like the windkessel model derived by Mandeville, J.B., Marota, J.J.A., Ayata, C., Zaharchuk, G., Moskowitz, M.A., Rosen, B.R., Weisskoff, R.M., 1999. Evidence of a cerebrovascular postarteriole windkessel with delayed compliance. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 19, 679-689, the VW model is primarily a model of haemodynamic changes in the venous compartment. The VW model is demonstrated to have the following characteristics typical of visco-elastic materials: (1) hysteresis, (2) creep, and (3) stress relaxation, hence it provides a unified model of the visco-elastic properties of the vasculature. The model will not only contribute to the interpretation of the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiments, but also find applications in the study and modelling of the brain vasculature and the haemodynamics of circulatory and cardiovascular systems. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Neurovascular coupling in response to stimulation of the rat barrel cortex was investigated using concurrent multichannel electrophysiology and laser Doppler flowmetry. The data were used to build a linear dynamic model relating neural activity to blood flow. Local field potential time series were subject to current source density analysis, and the time series of a layer IV sink of the barrel cortex was used as the input to the model. The model output was the time series of the changes in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). We show that this model can provide excellent fit of the CBF responses for stimulus durations of up to 16 s. The structure of the model consisted of two coupled components representing vascular dilation and constriction. The complex temporal characteristics of the CBF time series were reproduced by the relatively simple balance of these two components. We show that the impulse response obtained under the 16-s duration stimulation condition generalised to provide a good prediction to the data from the shorter duration stimulation conditions. Furthermore, by optimising three out of the total of nine model parameters, the variability in the data can be well accounted for over a wide range of stimulus conditions. By establishing linearity, classic system analysis methods can be used to generate and explore a range of equivalent model structures (e.g., feed-forward or feedback) to guide the experimental investigation of the control of vascular dilation and constriction following stimulation. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Specifically, we first briefly introduce the basics of color spaces including color appearance models. In the core of our paper, we survey colormap generation techniques, including the latest advances in the field by grouping these techniques into four classes: procedural methods, user-study based methods, rule-based methods, and data-driven methods; we also include a section on methods that are beyond pure data comprehension purposes. We then classify colormapping techniques into a taxonomy for readers to quickly identify the appropriate techniques they might use. Furthermore, a representative set of visualization techniques that explicitly discuss the use of colormaps is reviewed and classified based on the nature of the data in these applications. Our paper is also intended to be a reference of colormap choices for readers when they are faced with similar data and/or tasks.},

  abstract = {The haemodynamics of the arterial system can be described by the three-elements Windkessel model. As it is a lumped model, it does not account for pulse wave propagation phenomena: pulse wave velocity, reflection, and pulse pressure profile changes during propagation. The Modelflow\&copy; method uses this model to calculate stroke volume and total peripheral resistance (TPR) from pulse pressure obtained from finger; the reliability of this method is questioned.{$<$}p{$>$} {$<$}/p{$>$} The model parameters are: aortic input impedance (Zo), TPR, and arterial compliance (Cw). They were obtained from studies of human aorta preparation. Individual adjustment is performed based on the subject's age and gender. As Cw is also affected by diseases, this may lead to inaccuracies.{$<$}p{$>$} {$<$}/p{$>$} Moreover, the Modelflow\&copy; method transforms the pulse pressure recording from the finger (Finapres\&copy;) into a remarkably different pulse pressure in the aorta using a predetermined transfer function \textemdash{} another source of error. {$<$}p{$>$} {$<$}/p{$>$}In the present study, we indicate a way to include in the Windkessel model information obtained by adding carotid pulse recording to the finger pressure measurement. This information allows individualization of the values of Cw and Zo. It also seems reasonable to utilize carotid pulse, which better reflects aortic pressure, to individualize the transfer function.{$<$}p{$>$} {$<$}/p{$>$} Despite its simplicity, the Windkessel model describes essential phenomena in the arterial system remarkably well; therefore, it seems worthwhile to check whether individualization of its parameters would increase the reliability of results obtained with this model.},
